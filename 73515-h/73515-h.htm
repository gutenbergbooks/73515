<h2 class='no-screen'>1</h2>

<p class='ni'>According to Cunningham’s schedule there was a perfectly feasible route to
romance and to high adventure. It began wherever you happened to be and led to
Boston. There you took a train to Hatton Junction and changed to an
accomodation train of one passenger coach and one baggage car. That led you to
Bendale, New Hampshire, and there you hired a team. Both romance and adventure
were to be found somewhere around Coulters, which was eight miles from
Bendale. Cunningham was sure nobody else knew this secret because he had found
it in a highly unlikely place and almost anybody else who happened to look
there would find only dry statistics and descriptions.</p>

<p>However, as he boarded the accomodation train he inspected his fellow
passengers carefully. One upon a quest like Cunningham’s likes to feel that
his secret is his alone.</p>

<p>At first glance the passenger coach was reassuring. There were a dozen or more
passengers, but with two exceptions they were plainly people of the
countryside. New England farmers. Two women who had been shopping at the
Junction and were comparing their bargains. A swarthy French-Canadian
mill-hand with his dark-eyed sweetheart. Odds and ends of humanity; the
“characters” one finds in any New England village.</p>

<p>But even the two men Cunningham recognized as outsiders like himself were
wholly unlikely to be upon the same quest. One had the solid, pleasant
expression of a safe-and-sane man of business on his vacation, perhaps in
search of a good fishing-stream. The other was a foreigner, immaculately
dressed and with waxed mustaches, who was reading something that Cunningham
could not see and exhibiting all the signs of mounting rage. Cunningham might
have become curious about the foreigner at another time. He might have tried
to guess at his race and wonder what reading-matter could fill any man with
such evident fury.</p>

<p>But being upon the last stages of the route to romance, Cunningham thought of
nothing else. As to whether the girl would be as attractive as her picture, he
had no idea. Whether or not she had been married since it was taken, he could
not tell. What reception he would receive at the end of his journey was highly
problematical. He might be regarded as insane. He might&mdash;and he hugged the
knowledge to him tightly&mdash;he might run a very excellent chance of being
killed.</p>

<p>This was folly, of course, but Cunningham had an ample excuse. For ten years
he had toiled at a desk. He had worn a green celluloid eye-shade and added up
figures in a tall ledger, or made notes in a day-book, or duly pounded out,
“Yours of the fifteenth instant received and in reply would state...” at the
dictation of his employer. For eight hours out of the twenty-four, for eleven
and a half months out of the twelve, he made memos or orders and payments and
violations imposed and repairs made, and all connected with the business of a
firm which installed and repaired elevators.</p>

<p>And now he was free. An uncle, dimly remembered, had died without any heirs
but Cunningham. Cunningham had inherited fifty thousand dollars and within ten
minutes after receiving the news had resigned his job and punched his
employer’s rather bulbous nose.</p>

<p>Now he was in quest of adventure and romance. He considered that he had earned
them both. Ten years of law-abiding citizenship in New York entitled him to
all of adventure he could gather, and ten years in a boarding-house earned him
at least one authentic romance.</p>

<p>Cunningham had in his pocket the picture of a girl who lived a mile and a half
from Coulters, New Hampshire. The picture had been taken four months before
and her name was Maria. She was a pretty girl and had smiled at the camera
without self-consciousness. That was all that Cunningham knew about her, but
he had built up dreams to supply the rest. And he was quite insanely confident
that where she was, there would be romance.</p>

<p>But romance alone would not do. There must be adventure as well. And adventure
was duly promised. The picture was in the <i>Geographic Magazine</i> which travel-&nbsp;and
adventure-hungry folk devour. It was one of the illustrations of an
article prosaically entitled <i>Ethnological Studies in New Hampshire</i>, which
very soberly outlined the radical traits of New Englanders and the immigrants
who are supplanting them. And Maria was a Stranger&mdash;one of a group of people
who were a mystery and an enigma to all those around them.</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>They were two hundred people of unknown origin who spoke English far purer
than the New Hampshireites around them and avoided contact with their
neighbors with a passionate sincerity. They could not be classified even by
the expert on races of men who had written the article. They were not
Americans or Anglo-Saxons. They were not any known people. But whatever they
were, they were splendid specimens, and they were hated by their neighbors,
and they kept strictly away from all contact with all other folk. The New
Englanders charitably retailed rumors that more than one inquisitive visitor
among them had mysteriously disappeared. Strangest of all, they had appeared
from nowhere just two years before. They had bought ground and paid for it in
new, rough gold. And they refused violently to give any account of themselves.</p>

<p>This was where Cunningham was going. Where the prettiest girl in the world had
smiled unconsciously at a camera just four months before. Where a magnificent
unknown race was represented in the hodgepodge of New England’s later day.
Where inquisitive strangers might mysteriously disappear, where certain
hostility awaited too much questioning&mdash;and where the prettiest girl in the
world might possibly be induced to smile.</p>

<p>Cunningham knew it was foolish, but he considered that he had earned the right
to be a fool.</p>

<p>Then he looked up. The solid-looking man just opposite him had unfastened his
suit-case and taken out a sheaf of magazine pages, neatly clipped together. He
began to go through them as if they were totally familiar. Cunningham caught a
glimpse of a picture among them, and started. It was the same article from the
same magazine that had sent him here.</p>

<p>Then he heard a snarl, as of one who has contained himself until he can do so
no longer. His head jerked around and he found himself staring at the
foreigner who had seemed so angry. The man had the <i>Geographic Magazine</i> in
his hand. It was open at the page&mdash;the very page&mdash;on which the girl was
pictured. But the foreigner was looking at the type. Otherwise Cunningham as
one in quest of romance and adventure would have felt it necessary to
interfere an instant later. Because the foreigner glared at the page as if he
had read something that infuriated him past all possible control and suddenly
ripped the sheet across and across again, and threw the magazine upon the
floor and stamped upon it in a frenzy of rage.</p>

<p>He saw eyes fixed upon him, some startled and some slyly amused. He sat down
quivering with wrath and pretended to stare out of the window. But Cunningham
saw that his hands were clenching and unclenching as if he imagined that he
had something in his grasp which he would rend to bits.</p>

<h2><a id='ch2'></a>2</h2>

<p class='ni'>The accommodation train made innumerable stops. It stopped at “South Upton.”
It puffed into motion and paused at “East Upton.” A little later it drew up
grandly at “Upton.” Then it passed through “North Upton.”</p>

<p>The comfortable-looking man opposite Cunningham looked across and smiled.</p>

<p>“Now, if we stop at West Upton,” he suggested, “we can go on to a new name.”</p>

<p>Cunningham nodded and on impulse pulled the <i>Geographic Magazine</i> out of his
pocket and held it up.</p>

<p>“Same trail?” he asked.</p>

<p>The other man frowned and looked keenly at him. Then his face relaxed.</p>

<p>“I belong to the lodge,” he admitted. “Here’s my copy.”</p>

<p>Cunningham jerked his head at the third man.</p>

<p>“He had one too. He just tore it up. It seemed to make him mad.”</p>

<p>“That so?” The other looked steadily back at the foreign-seeming man, who was
staring out of the window with his face pale with fury. “Let’s ask him.”</p>

<p>He caught the foreigner’s eye an instant later and held up the magazine,
opened at the article on the Strange People.</p>

<p>“How about it? You going there too?” he asked pleasantly.</p>

<p>The foreigner went purple with fury.</p>

<p>“No!” he gasped, half-strangled with his own wrath. “I do not know what you
are talking about!”</p>

<p>He jerked himself around in his seat until they could see only his profile.
But they could see his lips moving as if he were muttering savagely to
himself.</p>

<p>“My name’s Cunningham,” said Cunningham. “I want to see those people. They
sound sort of interesting.”</p>

<p>“And my name’s Gray,” said the other, shifting to a seat beside Cunningham.
“I’m interested, too. I want to hear them talk. Dialect, you know. It’s my
hobby.”</p>

<p>“But they’re supposed to talk perfectly good English&mdash;&mdash;” began Cunningham,
when he stopped short.</p>

<p>The train had halted leisurely at a tiny station and the conductor was
gossiping with an ancient worthy on the station platform. A single passenger
had boarded the coach and entered the door. He looked unmistakably unlike the
other natives in the car, though he was dressed precisely in the fashion of
the average New Englander. But as he came into full view at the end of the
aisle he caught sight of the foreign passenger Cunningham had puzzled over.</p>

<p>The newcomer turned a sickly gray in color. He gave a gasp, and then a yell of
fear. He turned and bolted from the train, while the foreign passenger started
from his seat and with the expression of a devil raced after him. The newcomer
darted into a clump of trees and brushwood and vanished. The well-dressed
passenger stood quivering on the platform of the day-coach. The conductor
gaped at him. The other passengers stared.</p>

<p>Then the well-dressed man came quietly back inside and to his seat. Veins were
standing out on his forehead from fury and his hands were shaking with rage.
He sat down and stared woodenly out of the window, holding himself still by a
terrific effort of will.</p>

<p>Gray glanced sidewise at Cunningham.</p>

<p>“It looks,” he observed in a low tone, “as if our trail will have some
interesting developments. That man who just ran away was one of the Strange
People. He looks like the pictures of them. It ought to be lively up in the
hills when our friend yonder arrives. Eh?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I’ll say so,” said Cunningham joyously.</p>

<p>He talked jerkily with Gray as the train finished its journey. Without really
realizing it, he told Gray nearly everything connected with his journey and
his quest. Cunningham was busily weaving wild theories to account for the
scene when the first of the Strange People appeared before the third
passenger. Otherwise he might have recognized the fact that Gray was very
cleverly pumping him of everything he knew. But that did not occur to him
until later.</p>

<p>Gray looked more at ease when the train reached Bendale and he and Cunningham
sought a hotel together. They saw the third man sending a telegram and, again,
arranging for a horse and buggy at a livery stable. He ignored them, but his
lips were pressed together in thin, cruel lines.</p>

<p>Cunningham was very well satisfied as he arranged for his room and for a team
to take him to Coulters the next day. Ostensibly he was going to try for some
fishing, though nothing larger than minnows would be found in that section.
But Cunningham considered that the route to romance and adventure was
beginning to offer promise.</p>

<p>Still, next morning both he and Gray were startled when the hotel-keeper came
to them agitatedly.</p>

<p>“There was three strangers on the train yesterday, wa’n’t there?” he asked in
a high-pitched voice that trembled with excitement.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Cunningham. “Why?”</p>

<p>“D’ye know the other man?” asked the hotelkeeper excitedly. “Know who he was
or anything?”</p>

<p>“No, not at all,” Cunningham answered alertly, while Gray listened.</p>

<p>“Would ye recognize him if ye saw him?” quavered the hotel-keeper.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Cunningham. “Why? What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>Gray had struck a match to light a cigar, but it burned his fingers as he
listened.</p>

<p>“He rented a horse an’ buggy last night,” quavered the native. “He drove off
to Coulters way, he said. An’ this mornin’ the horse came back with him in the
buggy, but he was dead.”</p>

<p>“Dead!” Cunningham jumped and found himself growing a trifle pale.</p>

<p>“Yes, dead, that’s what he is!” said the innkeeper shrilly. “Them Strange
People done it! Because it looks like he was beat to death with clubs an’
maybe fifty men was on the job!”</p>

<h2><a id='ch3'></a>3</h2>

<p class='ni'>The route to romance led through Bendale to Coulters, but now there was a dead
man in the way. It had taken youth and hope and several other things to set
out as Cunningham had done in the first place. The quest of a pictured smile
among a strange people in unfamiliar country is not a thing the average young
man can bring himself to. He will be afraid of looking foolish. But to
continue on the quest when one has just seen a dead man the girl’s own people
have killed, more courage still is needed.</p>

<p>Cunningham was not quite so joyous now. He had gone with Gray to identify the
foreigner. He had turned sick at the expression on the man’s face. He had
promised to stay within call for the inquest. And then he and Gray had gone on
to Coulters.</p>

<p>Cunningham was not happy. Here was adventure, but it was stark and depressing.
And romance. The pictured face was no less appealing and no less ideal. But
the picture had been taken four months before. In the interval what might not
have happened? Many people were concerned in the killing of the foreigner. Did
the girl of the photograph know of it? Was she in the secret of the death that
had been dealt out? Did she know who had killed the man, or why?</p>

<p>“You’d a lot better have stayed behind, Cunningham,” said Gray, as their team
jogged over the country road to the summer boarding-house where they were to
stay. “I don’t think this is going to be pleasant from now on. No place for a
romance-hunter.”</p>

<p>“You’re not staying back,” Cunningham observed. “And you’re just following a
hobby.”</p>

<p>“Umph. That dialect business. Yes,” said Gray. His lips twitched grimly. “But
a hobby can be as exacting as a profession. Still, I didn’t expect to come up
here and run slap into a first-class murder.”</p>

<p>Gray puffed on his cigar and slapped the horses with the reins.</p>

<p>“The pleasantest part,” he added, “is that we shall probably be just about as
unwelcome as that chap was last night.”</p>

<p>Cunningham did not answer, and they drove in silence for a long time.</p>

<p>Discomforting thoughts assailed Cunningham. He knew as clearly as anyone that
it was absurd to grow romantic about a girl merely from a picture. But though
it may be absurd, it is by no means uncommon. The obtaining of autographed
photographs from Hollywood ranks with radio as a national occupation.
Cunningham was not disturbed by the comparative idiocy of traveling several
hundred miles and running into some danger just to see a girl whose picture
haunted his dreams. But the thought of finding her involved in such an
unpleasant mess as the killing of the foreigner; that was different.</p>

<p>A tidy-minded person would have abandoned the quest at once. He would have
abandoned the clearly marked trail to romance and high adventure and gone
home. A man who acted upon sober common sense would have done the same thing.
But such persons do not ever find romance and very rarely even the mildest of
adventures. It takes folly and belief to come at romance!&mdash;such folly as
enabled Cunningham presently to see his duty clear before him.</p>

<p>Maria needed someone to protect her. She was a Stranger, and the native New
Hampshireites hated the Strange People cordially. Cunningham had heard enough
at the police station that morning to know that the investigation of the
foreigner’s killing would be close to a persecution. But if Cunningham were
there, near enough to protect the girl who had smiled so shyly yet so
pleasantly at the camera, why&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Gray grunted suddenly.</p>

<p>“There’s our boarding-house,” he said, pointing with the whip. “I suppose the
Strange People live up in the hills yonder.”</p>

<p>Cunningham stared up at green-clad giants that were tumbled here and there and
everywhere in inextricable confusion and grandeur. Hill and valley, vale and
mountain, reared up or dipped down until it seemed that as far as the eye
could reach the earth had once been a playground of Titans.</p>

<p>A four-square, angular building of typical New England build lay beside the
road at the foot of the hills.</p>

<p>“They came here,” grunted Gray, waving his whip. “They had gold, rough gold,
to buy ground with. Where did they come from and why did they pick out this
part of the world to settle in? The soil’s too thin to grow anything much but
hay. The ground’s so rough you have to sow your fields with a shotgun. The
biggest crops are stones and summer boarders.”</p>

<p>“I’m wondering,” said Cunningham, whose thoughts had wandered as his eyes
roved the heights, “I’m wondering were they knew that chap that was killed.”</p>

<p>“Where they knew him?”</p>

<p>“The Stranger on the train recognized him at first glance. But that chap had a
copy of the <i>Geographic Magazine</i> and he’d found where they were from that. He
had learned about them just as we did.”</p>

<p>Gray frowned. Then he looked respectfully at Cunningham.</p>

<p>“You’re right. They knew him somewhere, a couple of years ago. But where?”</p>

<p>Cunningham shrugged.</p>

<p>“The article says nowhere.”</p>

<p>And the article did. According to the writer, the Strange People were an
enigma, an anomaly, and a mystery. And they had just proved that they could be
a threat as well.</p>

<p>The livery team drew up before Coulters’ solitary building. It was a
crossroads post-office and summer hotel with a dreary general store tucked
under one wing.</p>

<p>A man was sitting on the porch, smoking. He was watching them intently and as
they alighted he rose to greet them.</p>

<p>One glance made Cunningham exclaim under his breath. This man was the
counterpart of the foreigner on the train&mdash;the one who had been killed. The
same olive skin, the same keen and venomous eyes, and even the same too-full
lips with their incongruous suggestion of cruelty. He was dressed, too, in the
same immaculate fashion from meticulously tailored clothes to handmade boots.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” he said politely. “I’ve been hoping to find you here. You
reached Bendale on yesterday’s train?”</p>

<p>Gray’s face was quite impassive.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he admitted.</p>

<p>The foreigner exhibited half a dozen magazine pages. They were the ones
containing the article on the Strange People which had brought both Gray and
Cunningham to the spot.</p>

<p>“I believe you recognize this?”</p>

<p>Gray nodded, watching the man keenly.</p>

<p>“Before you arrange for rooms,” suggested the foreigner, smiling so that his
teeth showed unpleasantly, “I would like to speak to you a moment. My brother
saw you on the train. He telegraphed for me to meet you here. I may add that I
had myself driven all night over very bad roads to get here, and I probably
ruined a car in trying to meet you.”</p>

<p>“Well?” asked Gray shortly.</p>

<p>The foreigner reached into his pocket and pulled out a thick wallet. He opened
it, and an incredible mass of yellow-backed bills was exposed to view.</p>

<p>“In the first place,” he said pleasantly, “I would like to offer each of you a
present&mdash;let us say, five thousand dollars apiece&mdash;just to go home and forget
that you ever saw that magazine article or ever heard of the Strange People in
the hills up there.”</p>

<h2><a id='ch4'></a>4</h2>

<p class='ni'>Gray turned to the buckboard and began to hand down his suitcases. The last of
them was on the ground before he spoke.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we can’t do business,” he said without expression. “I am here on a
matter of scientific interest. I want to study their dialect. By the way, have
you had any news from Bendale this morning?”</p>

<p>The foreigner shook his head impatiently.</p>

<p>“News? No. But if I make it ten thousand&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” said Gray pleasantly. “I’m not in a money-making business.
My friend Cunningham may be willing to take you up.”</p>

<p>But Cunningham tossed his own suit-cases down.</p>

<p>“No,” he said contentedly. “I came here for fun. For adventure, if you choose
to put it that way. And anything I’m offered so much to stay out of must be
too much fun to miss.”</p>

<p>The foreigner gnawed at his fingertips as they started for the hotel.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment,” he said urgently. “Perhaps we can still come to some
agreement. You wish to study dialect? You wish to find adventure? We may still
work together.”</p>

<p>“How?” Gray put down his suitcases to light a cigar, while he gazed
abstractedly at the foreign-looking man.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;my name is Vladimir,” said the foreigner nervously. “I will promise
you five thousand dollars each and all assistance in your separate desires.
You”&mdash;he spoke to Gray&mdash;“you will have all opportunities to hear them talk and
study their speech. And you, er, you shall have all the adventures the hills
afford. If only you will, er, help us to maintain a certain, er, discretion.”</p>

<p>Cunningham found himself disliking this man extremely.</p>

<p>“Discretion?” he demanded. “You mean keep our mouths shut?”</p>

<p>Vladimir beamed at him.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes! You are a young man. Adventure? There are pretty girls in the hills.
I will give them orders. You will find them fascinating. And five thousand
dollars in addition to smiles&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Suppose you talk plainly,” said Gray shortly, before Cunningham could speak.</p>

<p>“You will find my brother among the Strangers,” Vladimir told them eagerly.
“You saw him on the train. Find him and tell him of the bargain I have just
made with you. And he will tell you just what you may repeat or speak of what
you see. And if you agree to work with us I will give you more money. Ten
thousand dollars!”</p>

<p>“But what is the work you are planning?” asked Gray, again before Cunningham
could reply. Cunningham was seething.</p>

<p>“It would not be wise to say. But the sheriff of the county has agreed to work
with us&mdash;for a gift, of course&mdash;and will assist us with the full force of the
law. If he does so, there can be no objection to your aiding us.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Gray gently. “The sheriff’s in it too?”</p>

<p>“To be sure. He&mdash;he will guide you to my brother,” offered Vladimir eagerly.
“Do not go inside the hotel. Let the sheriff take you to the hotel where my
brother waits. Talk to my brother. And you will earn ten thousand dollars
each!”</p>

<p>Cunningham’s head began to whirl. Vladimir hadn’t heard of the death of his
brother. But he had some plan to the detriment of the Strange People, and so
obviously of Maria. Otherwise he would not have found it necessary to bribe
the sheriff. And yet, both Vladimir and his brother had been at a long
distance the day before. They had hurried here on learning where the Strange
People were. The Strange People knew them and feared them; might even be
hiding especially from them! But why?</p>

<p>Cunningham could not explain it, but he knew that he had not mistaken the
route to adventure. Coulters was on the way. But there was a mile and a half
still to go.</p>

<p>Gray moved suddenly.</p>

<p>“Cunningham, if you want to take up this proposition&mdash;”</p>

<p>Cunningham picked up his bags and moved toward the hotel.</p>

<p>“I can’t fill the contract,” he said shortly.</p>

<p>“But it is so simple!” protested Vladimir. “Simply talk to my brother&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Gray was already up on the porch.</p>

<p>“Can’t do even that,” he said grimly. “You evidently haven’t heard. You’d
better get Bendale on the ’phone and find out. Your brother was on the train
with us yesterday, it’s true. He went up to the village of the Strangers last
night. But his horse brought his body back this morning. They’d killed him.”</p>

<p>Vladimir gasped, and went ashen. Sheer incredulity flashed across his
features. Then he believed and was stunned. But there was no grief whatever to
be seen on his face. Instead there was a terrible wrath, a rage so beastly and
cruel that Cunningham shivered when he saw it.</p>

<p>“They killed him, eh?” he said very softly, like a cat purring. “They dared to
kill him, eh? Ah, when I am through with them they will go down on their knees
and beg me to kill them! Beg me!”</p>

<p>His eyes were fixed and glassy with fury. Cunningham instinctively looked for
the foam of madness to appear upon his lips. But he turned and went softly
within the hotel.</p>

<p>“Charming example of family affection,” said Gray. “Why didn’t you take his
money?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t miss this,” Cunningham told him, “for ten times five thousand.
What in blazes is up in those hills?”</p>

<p>“I suggest,” Gray said dryly, “that we go and see. Got a gun?”</p>

<p>Cunningham nodded.</p>

<p>“There’s no time like the present,” grunted Gray. “The sheriff was over here,
busily being bribed, when that killing was discovered. Let’s get up in the
hills before it’s overrun with deputies. It won’t take a second to get our
rooms.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact it was nearly an hour later when they strode out of the
hotel and made abruptly for the mountain-slope.</p>

<p>For another hour they scrambled up stiff slopes among thorny brushwood and
small trees. Cunningham was already trying to sort out the hodgepodge of
events. Adventure&mdash;or mystery at any rate&mdash;crowded about him. Romance must
inevitably follow. That seemed so certain that he was almost able to discount
it. He was sure by now that Gray was not in the hills for any study of
dialects, and he contentedly ran over the list to date. A killing and the
offer of a bribe. A corrupted sheriff and the threat of ‘unspeakable revenge.
And Gray&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Cunningham, you see, was following a definite route which cut across common
sense and sanity. Therefore he kept his eyes open more widely than Gray. And
therefore he was tingling all over with a not altogether pleasant thrill when
Gray turned on him suddenly.</p>

<p>“Cunningham,” he said sharply, “tell me the truth for once. Why did you come
up here? Who sent you?”</p>

<p>Cunningham grinned, casting little side-glances at the trees about him.</p>

<p>“Nobody,” he said joyously. “I came up here for adventure and for romance. And
I’m finding them. For instance, there are half a dozen people hiding behind
those trees and watching us.”</p>

<p>“The devil!” Gray stopped short and stared about him. It was a creepy feeling
to realize that they were being spied upon from the woods. Suddenly he saw a
furtive movement as a blurred figure slipped from behind one trunk to another.
Its figure was that of a man, but he could see nothing else about it. “Creepy,
eh?” said Gray grimly.</p>

<p>“There’s a girl with them,” Cunningham told him. “<i>The</i> girl. Maria.”</p>

<p>But Gray rushed suddenly at a clump of brushwood as if to seize something
hiding there. A human figure started up and plunged away. And then something
came flicking through the air, glittering, and stuck fast in a tree-trunk with
a dull “<i>ping!</i>” It was a long-bladed knife, and it had missed Gray’s throat
by inches.</p>

<p>And without a word or a sign the air seemed suddenly full of the little
flickering flames which were knife-blades glittering in the sunlight. And
which, also, were death.</p>

<h2><a id='ch5'></a>5</h2>

<p class='ni'>Cunningham flung himself down on the ground. His revolver came out
instinctively, but he shouted, “We’re friends, you idiots! Friends!”</p>

<p>There was no answer, but the knives stopped their silent rush through the air.
It seemed as if the hidden men in the forest were debating in whispers, and
the stillness was deadly. Cunningham lay still, gradually worming his revolver
around to a convenient position for firing. He was tingling all over, but he
found himself thinking with a supreme irrelevance that he thought he had seen
the girl whose picture crackled in his breast pocket as he moved. He was quite
sure of it.</p>

<p>He stood up suddenly and began to dust himself off. It was taking a chance,
but it was wise. A young man stepped out from among the trees near by.</p>

<p>“You are our friends?” the young man demanded skeptically. “We have no
friends.”</p>

<p>His speech had but the faintest of slurs in it, a teasing soft unfamiliarity
which pricked one’s curiosity but could never be identified in any one
syllable, much less put down in print.</p>

<p>Cunningham felt an abrupt relief, and quite as abruptly wanted to swear. He
knew that this was the end of the route to romance and that the girl, Maria,
was peering out from the tangled underbrush. And he had dived head foremost
into a patch of loam and looked most unromantic. Therefore he said wrathfully,
“If we weren’t your friends, don’t you think we’d have plugged into you with
our gats? We saw you. You know that!”</p>

<p>The young man stared at him and Cunningham tried to rub the dirt off his nose
and look dignified at the same time, thinking of the girl behind the trees.</p>

<p>Then the young man said skeptically, “What is a gat?”</p>

<p>“A revolver. A pistol. A handgun,” snapped Cunningham. “We’d have wiped out
the lot of you.”</p>

<p>The man searched his face unbelievingly. A murmur came from somewhere behind
him.</p>

<p>“Show me,” he said. He came boldly out from the brushwood and faced Cunningham
squarely.</p>

<p>He was no older than Cunningham, but Cunningham instantly envied him his
build. He was magnificently made and splendidly muscled&mdash;as were all the
Strangers, as Cunningham learned later. He met Cunningham’s eyes frankly, yet
defiantly.</p>

<p>Cunningham turned to where Gray still lay sprawled out in a heap of brush.
Imperturbable puffs of smoke rose in the still woodland air.</p>

<p>“Go ahead and charm them, Cunningham,” said Gray’s voice dryly. “I’m under
cover and I’ll start shooting if they start anything.”</p>

<p>“Show me that you could have killed us,” repeated the young man, facing
Cunningham. “Use this thing you have.”</p>

<p>Cunningham held out his revolver. The Stranger looked at it curiously but
impassively. He seemed totally unfamiliar with its nature or use.</p>

<p>“Great guns!” demanded Cunningham in exasperation. “Don’t you know what it
is?”</p>

<p>The young man hesitated and then shook his head.</p>

<p>“No. I do not know what it is.”</p>

<p>He waited defiantly as Cunningham gaped at him. People in these United States
who had never seen a revolver! He grunted.</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll show you, then.”</p>

<p>He picked up a bit of weather-rotted rock and set it up for a target. He drew
off ten paces and leveled his pistol. He fired, and half the rock flew to
fragments. It was seamed and cracked by the freezings and thawings of many
years.</p>

<p>The young man flinched at the sound.</p>

<p>“It is like a shotgun,” he observed calmly. “You can use it twice. And then?”</p>

<p>He tapped the hilt of his knife suggestively.</p>

<p>“Then this,” snapped Cunningham.</p>

<p>He fired again and again and again. The rock was splinters.</p>

<p>“And I’ve still two shots left,” he observed grimly. “My friend yonder has six
more. If we were not your friends would we have waited for you to chuck rocks
at us?”</p>

<p>The young man debated. He inspected Cunningham’s face again.</p>

<p>“N-no,” he admitted. “Perhaps not. But why did you come here?”</p>

<p>Cunningham reached into his pocket and flipped the torn-out pages of the
magazine article to him.</p>

<p>“Look at the pictures. That’s why I came,” he said grimly. “And if you want to
know more&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The young man had cried out in astonishment. He turned and beckoned to the
woods behind him. A second man appeared. Then a third. They stared at the
pictures, fumbling them with their fingers.</p>

<p>The young man turned once more to Cunningham with a very pale face.</p>

<p>“Tell us,” he begged. “How did these come to be? Tell us! If you are our
friends, tell us everything!”</p>

<p>For all his blank astonishment, Cunningham realized that he had made a
bull’s-eye.</p>

<p>For ten minutes he talked to them, at first in commonplace speech, and as he
realized that the most ordinary of technical terms meant nothing to them, he
spoke as if to children. He watched their faces and explained until he saw
comprehension dawn. And he became filled with a vast incredulity. These people
spoke grammatical English, better than the native New Englanders. But they
knew nothing of revolvers, though they had seen shotguns and rifles. They knew
nothing of cameras, though they could read and write. And they were in a
civilized state of a civilized nation! Only the most passionately preserved
isolation and an incredible ignorance to begin with could account for it.</p>

<p>They listened intently. Now and again another figure crept out of the wood.
They were sitting in a semicircle about him now, watching his face as he
spoke. Old men, young men, but no sign of the girl. Presently the younger men
began to comment to one another on what Cunningham was saying. Gray got up and
sat down more comfortably with his back against a boulder. The comments of the
younger men were low-voiced, and sometimes one or another of them smiled.
Presently a little chuckle ran about the circle.</p>

<p>Cunningham stammered. He felt like a fool, explaining that he was here because
of an article in a magazine, and then having to explain what a magazine was,
what a camera was, and all the rest. It was when the feeling of folly was
strongest upon him that the chuckle went around. And then he noted that the
young men had been quietly retrieving the knives they had sent flickering
through the air. Everyone now had his knife back in his belt and was fingering
its hilt while he gazed smilingly at Cunningham.</p>

<p>The smiles were bland and friendly, but a feeling of horror came to him. They
were playing with him! They were pretending to listen to him, but actually
they were toying with him as a cat toys with a mouse. They ringed him about,
now, thirty or more of them. From time to time they edged closer to him. And
one of them would ask a question in that teasing soft unfamiliar dialect of
theirs, which you could not put your finger on. And he would edge a little
closer, and smile.</p>

<p>Sweat came out on Cunningham’s forehead. He felt as if he were in a nightmare.
The smiles were terrifying. They masked a sinister purpose, a deadly and
unspeakable purpose. Cunningham was remembering the dead man he had seen that
morning. Some of these men had done him to death. Now they were edging closer
to him, feigning to listen and feigning to smile.</p>

<p>He turned and found half a dozen of them very close to his back. He whirled
back again and saw that they had edged closer while his back was turned. They
sat upon the ground with their eyes fixed intently upon him, and smiled when
he looked at them, and asked questions in their soft and unfamiliar accent.
And always they moved closer....</p>

<p>Cunningham felt that his teeth would begin to chatter in an instant. And
suddenly a look of intelligence passed from one to another. A signal!</p>

<h2><a id='ch6'></a>6</h2>

<p class='ni'>Cunningham suddenly swung his pistol out. He was sweating in the horror they
had inspired. Once they came for him he would be calm enough, but this
ghoulish waiting until he should be momentarily off his guard was ghastly. He
flung out his pistol in a wide arc.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you some target practise,” he said suddenly. “Clear a lane over
there.”</p>

<p>He waved his hand and they parted reluctantly. Now and then they exchanged
glances. He could see some of them peering about, as if looking to make sure
that no one else was within sight. Cunningham managed to snatch a glance at
Gray. Gray was staring at him with a queer distaste, and Cunningham tried to
explain what he planned with a significant look. He’d clear a path for a rush,
and then they could stand these people off.</p>

<p>He slipped fresh shells in place of the exploded ones.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll hit that tree-trunk over there,” he said sharply. Gray should
understand and be ready to leap up. “Watch the bark fly.”</p>

<p>But Gray was sitting quite still. He was regarding Cunningham suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Like this,” snapped Cunningham. He glanced at Gray and made an almost
imperceptible motion for him to jump up. They’d have to run for it in a
moment.</p>

<p>He pressed on the trigger, and his eyes came back to the sights just as the
hammer was falling. It was too late to stop the explosion and his heart stood
still. From behind the very tree-trunk he was aiming at a girl’s face had
peered.</p>

<p>From sheer instinct he jerked at the weapon almost before his brain had
registered his impression. It went off with a roar, and as the echoes died
away he heard the rattling of several twigs falling to the ground.</p>

<p>Cunningham gasped and the revolver nearly fell from his hands as he saw her
still standing there, gazing interestedly at him. He rushed toward her, his
terror of an instant before all forgotten.</p>

<p>“I might have killed you!” he gasped. “Are you hurt? Are you?”</p>

<p>Her eyes opened wide and she flushed faintly. She moved as if to flee. Then
she glanced at the Strangers grouped about the place Cunningham had left and
stepped out into the open.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you made a very loud noise,” she said uncertainly. “That was all.”</p>

<p>It was the Girl. It was Maria, whose picture Cunningham had treasured and
about whom he had day-dreamed. At another time he might have risen to the high
heroic moment. He might have appeared in better guise. But in the transcendent
relief of finding her safe his wrought-up emotions found escape in the form of
rage. He whirled on the Strangers.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me she was there?” he demanded furiously. His horror of a
moment before had vanished completely. He was angry enough to have waded into
the bunch bare-handed. “You knew she was there! Damn it, I might have killed
her! I might have shot her! Idiots!” he cried, half sobbing from relief; “you
let me come close to killing her!”</p>

<p>Gray was still staring at him curiously.</p>

<p>“If you really mean these people well, Cunningham&mdash;&mdash;” he was beginning
curtly, when Cunningham turned to the girl again.</p>

<p>“Please forgive me,” he begged, still white and shaking from his scare. “I
didn’t know you were there!”</p>

<p>Her eyes met his wonderingly. Then the expression in them changed. She read
the terror and understood its cause. She smiled shyly.</p>

<p>“I was safe. My friends were there.”</p>

<p>She meant the thirty or more Strangers, staring puzzledly at Cunningham and
bewildered by his evident horror. Cunningham’s head cleared with a jerk. He
felt more than ever like a fool. All men are tempted to feel that way in the
presence of a pretty girl, if only to keep the pretty girl company, but
Cunningham saw that the Strangers were honestly at a loss. There had been no
secret purpose. They were as incredibly uninformed as they had seemed and they
had been listening with all the attention their actions had displayed.</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Cunningham abjectly, “I guess I seem like a fool to you,
Maria, but I did come here only to see you. I&mdash;I’ve been day-dreaming about
you. Let me show you why I was scared and you’ll understand what it would have
meant if I had hit you.”</p>

<p>He took her hand and fitted it to the pistol-grip. He put her finger on the
trigger.</p>

<p>“Now, point it off that way,” he went on anxiously, “squeeze on this
thing....”</p>

<p>There was the swift thudding of horses’ hoofs. A nasal voice cried shrilly,
“Halt in th’ name of th’ law!”</p>

<p>Cunningham started and instinctively held fast to his revolver, which someone
seemed trying to jerk away. He caught a glimpse of flying figures melting into
the woods. Then he saw two men on horseback plunging up to the spot. One wore
a bright star on his chest and the other carried a rifle.</p>

<p>“There, naow!” the sheriff of the county exclaimed, panting. “I got one of
’em, even if it was a girl.”</p>

<p>He lunged from his horse and seized Maria, who was wrenching frantically to
get her finger out of the trigger-guard Cunningham had held tightly.</p>

<p>She flashed a glance of bitter hatred at Cunningham.</p>

<p>“Easy,” said Cunningham with sudden heat. “What are you arresting her for? I
was showing her how to shoot a revolver.”</p>

<p>“No thanks to ye for that, then,” panted the sheriff. “Here, Joel, come an’
help me get the cuffs on her.”</p>

<p>Cunningham brought down a heavy hand on the sheriff’s arm.</p>

<p>“What’s this for?” he demanded hotly. “I didn’t hold her for you!”</p>

<p>“I’m arrestin’ her for murder, that’s what. She’s one of them Strange People,
she is. An’ they killed that furriner last night. You know that. You saw him
this mornin’. Mr. Vladimir told me. Joel, come here an’ help me. Help me get
her hands in these cuffs.”</p>

<p>Cunningham wrenched the sheriff’s hands free.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool,” he snapped angrily. “That killing was the work of men! This
girl had nothing to do with it!”</p>

<p>“I warn ye not to interfere with the law!” growled the sheriff.</p>

<p>“I’m not interfering with the law,” said Cunningham hotly. “I’m interfering
with your doing what Vladimir’s bribed you to do! This girl would never get to
jail. Vladimir’s much too anxious to get some of the Strangers in his hands.
Hands off!”</p>

<p>He thrust the girl behind him, where she cowered for a moment.</p>

<p>“Get out of here,” snapped Cunningham. “And you start something about my
resisting the law and I’ll start something about your taking bribes! Clear out
and leave this girl alone!”</p>

<p>“Ye better not shield a murderer&mdash;&mdash;” whined the sheriff uneasily.</p>

<p>“If you want murderers, look for men,” said Cunningham coldly. “Then I won’t
stop you. But stick to the law, Sheriff, and forget about Vladimir.”</p>

<p>He drew back with the girl behind him and his eyes blazing. The revolver that
had snared the girl was still clutched in his hand. The sheriff gazed at him
venomously.</p>

<p>“I’ll tend to ye,” he said uncertainly.</p>

<p>“Try it,” Cunningham growled as he watched the two men ride slowly away. He
watched until they had disappeared. Then he turned to Maria.</p>

<p>She was gone.</p>

<p>Cunningham stared blankly, then grinned sheepishly at Gray.</p>

<p>“I guess that was foolish, maybe,” he apologized, “but he made me mad.”</p>

<p>Gray was white as a sheet, but he tried to smile as he got up stiffly.</p>

<p>“You did good work for me,” he said grimly. “Look at my coat.”</p>

<p>He turned and showed a little rip in the back.</p>

<p>“When those chaps made for the woods,” he said grimly, “one of them dropped
behind my own particular boulder and stuck the point of a knife in my back. If
the sheriff had taken that girl off, the knife would have been sunk in me.
Ugh! Let’s go back to Coulters.”</p>

<h2><a id='ch7'></a>7</h2>

<p class='ni'>The hills rose until they blotted out half the stars, and the moonlight on
their tree-clad slopes was like a screen of opaque lace against the sky. Utter
solitude seemed to surround the little summer boardinghouse. No other house
was in view. No lights burned in the houses the Strange People must occupy in
the hills. All was silence.</p>

<p>Gray stood up and tossed away his last cigar.</p>

<p>“I’m going to turn in,” he said at last. “It’s too much for me. By the way, I
may be gone before you get up in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Leaving?” asked Cunningham.</p>

<p>He and Gray had been talking fruitlessly, trying to piece together what they
knew of Vladimir with what they had seen of the Strangers, and attempting to
figure out the connection between the two. They had decided that the
Strangers’ attack upon them had been due to Gray’s rush at one of the hidden
figures. That their hiding was due to the fact that they had killed Vladimir’s
brother and were afraid of arrest. But they could concoct no theory as to why
Vladimir had sought them out, or where he could have known them, or why he was
willing to spend any amount of money to have a free hand with them. Certainly
they could not understand what he would gain besides revenge, or even how he
could set about taking that in a civilized country.</p>

<p>“No, not leaving,” said Gray. He yawned. “You don’t care to confide in me,
Cunningham? About your real reason for being here?”</p>

<p>Cunningham grinned. The route he had followed had not misled him. Adventure
and romance were certainly about him. He had seen Maria, and she was perfect.
And there was promise of more excitement.</p>

<p>“I’ve told you,” he said cheerfully. “I came here for fun. Why not tell me why
you came?”</p>

<p>Gray smiled.</p>

<p>“Dialect, of course.” His tone admitted that he did not expect Cunningham to
believe it. “I’ll send some wires and be back by noon. Watch your step while
I’m gone. I think Vladimir would feel happier with you in jail.”</p>

<p>“I know he would,” said Cunningham. “But there’s something crooked going on. I
shall object pretty strenuously to being arrested.”</p>

<p>Gray laughed.</p>

<p>“I think you will,” he admitted. “But today I thought you were just trying to
hold the Strangers in talk until the sheriff could reach them unheard. I think
they thought the same.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t hear the son-of-a-gun,” said Cunningham.</p>

<p>Gray yawned again on his way to the door.</p>

<p>“I knew it when you fought to keep that girl from being arrested. Didn’t you
notice I told you about the knife at my back right away? So that the Strangers
would hear me? I wanted them to know you’d kept her free on your own hook, not
to save my life. That ought to make them believe in you somewhat.”</p>

<p>“But why did you want to make me solid with them?” demanded Cunningham.</p>

<p>“Oh, you might help me later,” said Gray dryly, “in studying their dialect.”</p>

<p>He disappeared, and Cunningham frowned out at the darkness for a long time. It
was a puzzling mix-up, and it might prove a dangerous one. Gray had been close
to death that afternoon and one man had been killed. But Cunningham could not
find it in his heart to dwell upon anything, now, but Maria. She
was&mdash;different. Cunningham dwelt upon her image in his memory with increasing
contentment. Sometimes a man sees a woman and without even any feeling of
surprize realizes that it is she whom he has been waiting for all his life. It
is more of a recognition than a meeting. Cunningham felt that way about Maria.</p>

<p>But he forced his brain to a last effort to understand the mystery into which
he had dropped. Vladimir offering bribes to keep other people from the
Strangers he hated, and the Strangers with their incredible lack of knowledge
of American commonplaces.</p>


<p>“Vladimir’s crazy, or I’m crazy, and maybe all of us are crazy,” he muttered
as he tossed his cigarette over the porch railing. “I’m going to bed.”</p>

<p>He went up the stairs by the light of the turned-down lamp in the hall and
fumbled with his key in the lock. He opened his door and struck a match. Then
he uttered an angry exclamation.</p>

<p>A moment later he had lighted his lamp and was searching among his
tumbled-about possessions for a sign of theft.</p>

<p>Someone had entered his room and searched his suit-cases thoroughly. His
clothes had been ransacked. A bundle of letters and papers had been read and
strewn on the floor. It looked as if every seam of his garments had been
searched for hidden clues to his identity or motive in visiting Coulters and
the Strange People.</p>

<p>Nothing was missing, but everything had been examined. Cunningham felt his
anger mounting. Vladimir, of course. Why didn’t the man want him there? What
was he suspected of?</p>

<p>There was a gentle tapping at his window and Cunningham looked up with an
increase of savagery. But&mdash;two faces were looking in at him. One was Maria,
smiling a little. The other was a Stranger of middle age or over.</p>

<p>She put her finger to her lips and motioned for him to lift the window.
Cunningham strode over and thrust it up. It was latched from the inside and
the necessity of unfastening it dispelled a flash of suspicion that had come
to him.</p>

<p>“This is my father, Stephan,” whispered Maria. “We must talk to you.”</p>

<p>The older man slipped into the room and after an instant’s hesitation held out
his hand. He looked weary and worn.</p>

<p>“I could not come any other way,” he said slowly, picking his words with a
trace of difficulty. “I would have had to kill the sheriff. But I wished to
thank you, for Maria.”</p>

<p>She had slipped in behind him and sat down on a chair. Stephan waited until
Cunningham motioned him to another. There he sat quietly, fingering the hilt
of his knife and looking at Cunningham with grave and not unfriendly eyes.</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>Cunningham was hopelessly at sea, but he felt a little tingling feeling of
comfort. He looked at Maria, and there was an infinite deal of satisfaction in
the glance. It was as if he saw her and knew with perfect certitude that some
day she must love him. For himself, with sublime confidence he knew that his
dreams were justified. It was insane, perhaps, but such things do happen. One
worships very many girls, very earnestly, and then quite suddenly one glimpses
another girl and&mdash;well, one <i>knows</i>.</p>

<p>Stephan’s voice broke the silence again.</p>

<p>“I came,” he said heavily, “to thank you for keeping Maria from being taken
away. And I ask you if you are our friend, as you said. And why you came
here.”</p>

<p>Cunningham pondered the reply he should make. He saw Maria looking at him with
a curious expression of dawning recognition, of surprized intentness. He
glanced up and she flushed slightly. Very abruptly he saw that she had read
his expression and that she was discovering the same odd certitude. Their eyes
met for the fraction of a second. And then&mdash;it was as if there were no more
need to speak. She flushed a vivid red, and after that her eyes had difficulty
in meeting his.</p>

<p>That, also, was insanity. But such things happen likewise.</p>

<p>“I am your friend,” said Cunningham gruffly, “if Vladimir isn’t. I dislike
that man.”</p>

<p>His heart was pounding loudly, though no word had passed between Maria and
himself. Stephan eyed him steadily.</p>

<p>“But I’m getting tired,” added Cunningham, “of explaining why I came here and
where I came from. Nobody believes me. But you didn’t come to ask me those
things only.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Stephan harassedly. “We came to ask you what to do.”</p>

<p>“About what?”</p>

<p>“All things,” said Stephan fiercely. “A man was killed. You know that. There
is another man here. You call him Vladimir, and he will have to be killed
also. And the sheriff comes and tries to take us away. What shall we do?”</p>

<p>Cunningham had trouble in thinking of an answer. He wanted to talk to Maria.
He wanted to take her to one side and say innumerable things.</p>

<p>“About the first man,” he said at random, “you ought to get a lawyer to advise
you. And keep out of the way of Vladimir and the sheriff until he can tell you
what you ought to do.”</p>

<p>Stephan’s face mirrored a resolute despair.</p>

<p>“No. We will not do that. He would ask who we were and why we killed that
other man.”</p>

<p>“He might,” agreed Cunningham lightheartedly. He wanted desperately to talk to
Maria. “People do that sort of thing around here.”</p>

<p>Stephan looked at his daughter questioningly. She nodded, with shining eyes
that evaded Cunningham’s. Stephan tugged at his belt and placed something on
the floor before him. He unknotted a string about a coarse cloth bag and
poured out upon the floor a shining heap of gold-pieces. But they were not
like any gold-pieces Cunningham had ever seen before. They were hammered from
nuggets or bars by hand. They were square, about the size of a double-eagle
and twice as thick, and still showed the marks of the hammer that had formed
them.</p>

<p>“We will give you these,” he said quietly, “if you will get us gats like the
one you showed my people today.”</p>

<p>“Gats? Oh ... guns. Pistols.”</p>

<p>Stephan nodded and swept the gold-pieces into a shining array. The sight of
them sobered Cunningham abruptly.</p>

<p>“But what will you do with them?” he asked. “How will you use them? What do
you want them for?”</p>

<p>Stephan spread out his hands.</p>

<p>“Then we will not need a lawyer,” he said grimly. Cunningham caught his
meaning.</p>

<p>“How many people do you chaps plan to kill with them?”</p>

<p>Stephan smiled sadly.</p>

<p>“Not many. Only until we are left alone.”</p>

<p>“You people do need a guardian,” growled Cunningham. Maria was watching him
with soft eyes that always just evaded meeting his. Cunningham felt that a
tremendous responsibility was being thrust upon him. “Look here&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>There was a sharp knock at the door.</p>

<p>Cunningham hurled himself at the doorway to bar entrance until Stephan and
Maria should have time to get away. All the Strangers were considered outlawed
now. Cunningham had only their safety in mind, but Stephan misread his
swiftness of movement. With lightninglike quickness he was on his feet with
bared knife, darting likewise to the doorway.</p>

<p>Cunningham’s hand came down with a jerk. The knife flew from Stephan’s hand
and stuck quivering in the floor. The next second Cunningham’s revolver was
out.</p>

<p>“Steady!” he whispered sharply. “Steady!”</p>

<p>Then Maria had flung herself in front of the revolver. All this was done in
fractions of seconds and almost without sound.</p>

<p>“You shall not let him be taken!” she whispered fiercely. “You shall not!”</p>

<p>Stephan’s whole frame was alert and his eyes were flaming as if he were sure
this was a trap and waited but the ghost of a chance to seize his knife and
rush Cunningham as well as whoever might be outside.</p>

<p>To take his eyes from the man was to risk his life. To refuse to answer the
knock was to take another risk. The knock came again, sharp and peremptory. A
hand tried the door. And there was a tiny sound by the window, as if other
Strangers were without, peering in suspiciously and ready to fling their
flying knives at a hint of danger.</p>

<h2><a id='ch8'></a>8</h2>

<p class='ni'>Maria defied Cunningham without words. And Cunningham saw her father’s hand
stealing to a part of her dress where a weapon might be concealed. Sweat came
out on his forehead. He could not shoot, and in another instant&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Then the defiance in her eyes turned to pleading and the deliberate wordless
reiteration of the thing he had read in her face before. Cunningham spoke
suddenly in a fierce whisper.</p>

<p>“I love you!” he cried softly and desperately. “Do you think I will let harm
come to your father?”</p>

<p>The terror faded from her eyes and without a sound she clasped her father’s
hands fast in her own, though still before him. Stephan stood tense, watching
Cunningham through eyes that showed nothing whatever.</p>

<p>Cunningham turned his head.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” he called. The answer was an anticlimax.</p>

<p>“Gray,” said Gray’s voice dryly. “I say&mdash;if you want to send any mail or
telegrams, you’d better give them to me. I think they’d be opened, here.”</p>

<p>“I know they would,” Cunningham growled. “But I won’t have anything to go out.
Anything else? I’m in bed,” he added as an afterthought.</p>

<p>“No. Nothing else.” Gray’s tone was very dry. Cunningham heard his footsteps
retreating.</p>

<p>He silently picked up Stephan’s knife and handed it back. He replaced his
pistol in his pocket.</p>

<p>“It’s dangerous to talk here,” he said grimly. “I suppose these partitions are
thin. Let me come up to the hills tomorrow. I’ll tell you anything I can to
help you. But please don’t kill anybody else until I’ve had time to explain.
Don’t you understand that you can’t get away with that sort of thing in the
United States? Where did you come from, anyhow?”</p>

<p>Stephan smiled faintly. He ignored the whisper to Maria of a moment before. He
suddenly reached over and put his hand on Cunningham’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Good man,” he said gravely. “We will talk to you, yes. But we will not tell
you anything. Come up into the hills tomorrow. We will kill nobody else until
you say.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;I tell you you mustn’t kill anybody at any time,” protested Cunningham
anxiously. “You can’t get away with it. Don’t you understand?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Stephan. He spread out his hands in a confession of despair. “We do
not understand anything! Maria says you are our friend. We need a friend. Else
we die. And if you do not help us&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Cunningham stared from one to the other, but it was hard to think of anything
when he looked at Maria. He had taken the Strangers seriously enough when he
knew of the first man’s being killed. Now it looked as if he was called upon
to prevent deadly serious trouble in the hills.</p>

<p>“I’ll try,” he said hopelessly. “Yes, I’ll try. Maria&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The color mounted in her cheeks. Then she seemed to summon all her pride and
met his eyes fairly. They told him many things, her eyes.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I will wait for you,” she told him. And in the words she said much more
than the words themselves.</p>

<p>Cunningham was tingling all over, at the same time that he felt a curious
sense of absurdity in escorting callers to the window instead of to the door.
But before they reached it a head appeared there. It was that of the young
Stranger who had been the first to appear from the woods that afternoon.</p>

<p>“The sheriff,” he whispered. “He came. We hit him on the head. Shall we kill
him?”</p>

<p>“No!” said Cunningham sharply. “Tie him up until you get clear away. Did he
see you coming up to my window?”</p>

<p>“No.” The young man shrugged and disappeared. There were whispered
instructions below. To Cunningham it seemed that the whispers were in a
strange tongue. Maria and her father slipped out. Then there were little
rustlings below. The ladder, probably, being taken down and carried elsewhere,
and the marks it had made in the earth erased.</p>

<p>Cunningham sank into a chair and stared before him. His blood was still
pounding in his veins. And Maria had glanced back at him as she disappeared
from view. But there was no denying that a tremendous and unwelcome
responsibility had been thrust upon him.</p>

<p>They were foreigners. They must be. They did not understand the laws of the
United States&mdash;and they were hated now and would soon be subject to
persecution. Why, otherwise, did Vladimir bribe the sheriff and try to keep
both Gray and Cunningham away from the Strange People? Why, otherwise, had
such unreasoning hatred been expressed that morning in Bendale?</p>

<p>And it was up to Cunningham to prevent a wholesale tragedy. For some unknown
reason they believed that he was their friend. They would not kill anyone
until he had spoken to them. That was the promise Stephan had made in their
behalf,&mdash;and yet they were not bloodthirsty. He had said they only wished to
be let alone, and he could not understand that that was the surest way to be
thoroughly investigated. They depended now upon Cunningham. Before, without a
counselor, they had killed. Now, unless Cunningham aided them, they would kill
again. And Cunningham felt that the responsibility of human lives was more
than he had bargained for.</p>

<p>Adventure was all very well, and romance was all very well, but this was
different and in deadly earnest. And Cunningham could not feel any sense of
superiority to them, as most men feel toward most uninformed foreigners. They
were unlike him, but they were certainly not inferior to him. They knew less,
but they gave no indication of lesser intelligence. And Maria&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Cunningham stood up, a trifle pale.</p>

<p>“Well,” he muttered, “I asked for adventure and I guess I’ve got it.”</p>

<p>There was another knock on the door.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he demanded. He wanted to be alone to think.</p>

<p>““Gray,” said a dry voice. “Have you gotten out of bed, Cunningham?”</p>

<p>Cunningham opened the door.</p>

<p>“I came in,” said Gray dryly, “to mention that Vladimir went through my room
while I was gone. One key will unlock any door in this sort of hotel.”</p>

<p>“He went through mine, too,” said Cunningham abstractedly.</p>

<p>“And also,” said Gray still more dryly, “to mention that the partitions here
are very thin and that I heard all of the conversation just now.”</p>

<p>Cunningham looked up with a start.</p>

<p>“I knocked on your door,” Gray added, smiling cryptically, “because I knew you
wouldn’t open it. I was doing what I could to cement their confidence in you.
Are you going to help them?”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ve got to try,” said Cunningham grimly. “But I wish I knew what to
do.”</p>

<p>“Keep them from killing,” Gray told him with sudden sharpness. “And also, keep
them out of jail. You’ve got to do it, Cunningham! There’ll be hell to pay in
those hills if you don’t. These people are scared. That’s why they killed that
man we saw on the train. And they will be worse scared of Vladimir. He hasn’t
gone, and if I can read faces he’s planning devilment for them. I tell you
there’ll be wholesale killings in the hills unless you go up there! Stay with
them. Argue with them. Educate them if you must. But keep them from killing
anybody!”</p>

<p>“And who,” asked Cunningham grimly, “is going to keep Vladimir from starting
something?”</p>

<p>Gray spread out his hands. Then he said curtly, “Look here. I tell you
nothing&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Just like most other people,” interpolated Cunningham none too cordially.</p>

<p>“&mdash;&mdash;nothing,” went on Gray, ignoring the interruption, “but I can promise
that you won’t get into trouble through trying to keep the peace.”</p>

<p>“You’re a detective?”</p>

<p>“No,” snapped Gray. “I’m not. But I can promise that much.”</p>

<p>“All those who have made mysteries of themselves so far,” observed Cunningham
grimly, “have offered me money. What do you offer?”</p>

<p>Gray stopped short. He seemed to realize for the first time just what sort of
a predicament Cunningham was in, hopelessly at sea regarding the motives of
every person in the extraordinary triangle.</p>

<p>“Advice,” he said soberly after an instant. “I’ll offer you advice. That girl
is devilish pretty and I heard what you said to her. And it’s insanity to say
it, but&mdash;either avoid her entirely or marry her at once. And I mean at once!
I’ve a reason for warning you.”</p>

<p>And just as he put his hand on the knob of the door there was a scream on the
ground outside. Maria had screamed. There was a crashing of glass, and as
Cunningham hurled himself to his feet a shot followed, which was sickeningly
loud and reverberated horribly in the stillness.</p>

<p>Then Vladimir’s voice came purringly from a spot near by, as if he were
gloating to himself, “Ha! I got her!”</p>

<h2 class='no-screen'><a id='ch9'></a>9</h2>

<p class='ni'>With a face like death Cunningham flung through the door. He sped down the
steps with his heart, it seemed, stopped dead. There were sounds behind him
and angry voices. Gray roaring at Vladimir, perhaps. But Cunningham could
think of nothing but Maria.</p>

<p>The darkness smote his eyes like a blow. He stumbled and fell, then started
up, crying out wildly.</p>

<p>A figure flitted up to him and put a soft hand over his mouth.</p>

<p>“Hush! Hush! I am safe,” she whispered breathlessly. “He saw us about the
sheriff, and fired. When he saw the sheriff fall he thought I was killed.
Hush!”</p>

<p>Cunningham’s arms were about her and he kissed her in an ecstasy of relief.</p>

<p>“If he’d killed you!” he gasped. “If he’d killed you!”</p>

<p>Feet thundered indoors.</p>

<p>“I must go!” she whispered swiftly. “Please!”</p>

<p>She thrust him away and fled. Figures were waiting for her. She joined them,
and all melted into nothingness beneath the trees. Then Gray stumbled outside
with his hand in Vladimir’s collar.</p>

<p>“Did he get her, Cunningham?” he cried shakenly. “If he did, I swear I’ll
fling him to them! Did he get her?”</p>

<p>“N-no,” said Cunningham unevenly. He wiped the sweat off his forehead.
“They’re all gone. But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He knelt beside a dark bundle on the ground. A groan came to his ears,
curiously muffled. He struck a match and found the sheriff securely trussed up
and blinking at the match-flame with panic-stricken eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s the sheriff,” said Cunningham. “Maybe he’s hurt.”</p>

<p>But a babble of words that began before the gag was completely out of his
mouth proved that the sheriff was only scared.</p>

<p>“Scared green, that’s all,” said Gray curtly. He shook Vladimir as a terrier
might shake a rat. “You thought there were burglars?” he roared. “Try to get
away with that again! You aimed for that girl!”</p>

<p>He tossed Vladimir to the ground, wrathfully.</p>

<p>“What girl?” purred Vladimir, as he scrambled to his feet. “Was there a girl?
Are you in communication with my brother’s murderers? And helping them to
escape, too? I think you will go to jail, my friend.”</p>

<p>But Gray went indoors with Cunningham, laughing.</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>When day came again Cunningham awoke with the conviction that something
very pleasant had happened. He puzzled vaguely over it for a long time. And
then he realized that it was a thing that had come to him just before he slept
and had made his heart pump faster and more loudly. When he kissed Maria, she
had not struggled nor been angry. On the contrary she had lifted her lips to
his. And yet it had been no practised gesture, but the response of sheer
instinct to one man only.</p>

<p>Cunningham’s heart pounded a little and he got up with a serene contentment
filling him. The route to romance had led him to happiness, he was sure.</p>

<p>He went downstairs and went out on the porch just to look up at the hills in
which he would find her presently.</p>

<p>Vladimir was there, talking to a newcomer whose clothing and air confirmed the
guess that he was a servant. But not an ordinary servant. His face was gross
and stupid where Vladimir’s was keen and cruel, but his features had no less
of instinctive arrogance, though veiled by servility at the moment.</p>

<p>Vladimir’s lips twitched into a snarl of hatred when he saw Cunningham, and he
spoke to his servant. The man looked at Cunningham and scowled.</p>

<p>But Cunningham went indoors and had breakfast joyously. Then he started out to
find Maria. Technically, as he reflected, he was compounding a felony in going
to the Strange People to advise them how to keep out of the clutches of the
law. Some of them had been involved in the killing of Vladimir’s brother. But
Cunningham beamed as he clambered up the steep hillside toward those
mysterious thickets in which the Strange People lurked.</p>

<p>He had gone up perhaps half the way when he heard a faint rustling behind him.
He turned and shouted, thinking it a Stranger who would lead him to Stephan
and Maria. But the rustling stopped. After a little while he went on,
frowning. Later the rustling began again, somewhat nearer.</p>

<p>And then Cunningham heard whistles far off in the thickets. He heard other
rustlings, as if men were moving swiftly through the undergrowth. These last
sounds came from both sides of him. And then he came suddenly upon a young
Stranger, running headlong toward him with his hand on his knife-hilt. The
Stranger lifted his hand, unsmilingly, and ran on.</p>

<p>“Stephan,” cried Cunningham; “where is he?”</p>

<p>The runner waved for Cunningham to continue as he was going and disappeared.
The mysterious sounds continued, to right and to left. Then everything was
abruptly very still.</p>

<p>Cunningham halted uncertainly. There was no trace of a path anywhere. The
earth fell away sharply at one side but he had lost all sense of direction and
did not know which way to go. Then he heard a thrashing below him as if
someone were moving rapidly to cut him off.</p>

<p>Then there was the sound of panting near by and a small boy ran into view. He
was a young Stranger, an aquiline-nosed, brown-eyed youngster with the legs of
a race-horse.</p>

<p>“Hi, there,” shouted Cunningham. “Where’s Stephan?”</p>

<p>The boy gasped in relief and flew toward him. He thrust a bit of paper into
Cunningham’s hand and stood panting. Cunningham unrolled the scrap. On it was
written in awkward letters:</p>

<blockquote>
“Someone follows to kill you. What will happen if we kill him?”
</blockquote>

<p>Cunningham started. Vladimir! He’d sent his servant to bushwhack him.</p>

<p>“They’ll hang,” he said grimly. “Tell them not to do it.”</p>

<p>The boy nodded and started off.</p>

<p>“Wait!” called Cunningham. “Will they stop, since I’ve said so?”</p>

<p>“No,” panted the boy. “They kill him already, I think.”</p>

<p>He sped away, down toward the spot where the thrashing in the bushes sounded
as if someone were trying to head Cunningham off. Cunningham clenched his
fists and ran after him, determined to stop the foolishness.</p>

<p>The boy vanished suddenly. A figure started up.</p>

<p>“Wait! He lives yet! Wait!”</p>

<p>But Cunningham plunged on, not understanding. He only hoped to be in time to
keep the Strangers from worse trouble than they were already in.</p>

<p>He burst through a thicket as warning cries sounded suddenly from all sides.
And there was Vladimir’s servant, staring stupidly about him in sudden fright
at the sound of many voices. He was waist-high in brushwood. He swerved in
panic at the sound of Cunningham’s rush; then his face lighted with ferocity.
With lightning quickness he had leveled a weapon and fired.</p>

<p>Cunningham’s life was due to the fact that he had just tripped upon one of the
innumerable small boulders strewn all over the slopes. He was falling as the
bullet left the gun. He felt a searing pain in his left shoulder and crashed
to the ground. Maria’s voice shrilled in anguish.</p>

<p>“Dead! He is killed!”</p>

<p>The breath was knocked out of Cunningham, but he struggled to shout that he
was all right, and was afraid to because the servant might pot at him again.</p>

<p>But then he heard half a dozen little metallic clangings, like the rattle of
steel knife-blades on rock. The air was full of minor whirrings. And then he
heard a sudden agonized bellow, like the roaring of a wounded bull. And then a
man screaming in horrible terror.</p>

<h2><a id='ch10'></a>10</h2>

<p class='ni'>There was an air of formality, even of solemnity, in the gathering that faced
Cunningham several hours later. A full two hundred Strangers were gathered in
a little glade with slanting sides that formed a sort of amphitheater. Scouts
were hidden in the woods beyond.</p>

<p>And Maria was there, with a white and stricken face which dashed Cunningham’s
joyous mood. Vladimir’s servant was there too, ashen with dread and with a
crude bandage about his arm where a throwing-knife had gone through his
muscles as he tried to shoot Cunningham a second time. And Stephan, Maria’s
father, with his features worn and very weary.</p>

<p>Cunningham’s shoulder had been dressed with crushed plantain-leaves. It was a
tiny wound at best, hardly worth more than adhesive plaster. The bullet had
barely nicked the skin, but Maria had wept over it as she bound it up.</p>

<p>Cunningham had felt that this was no time for common sense. He knew.</p>

<p>“I love you,” he whispered as she bent down above him.</p>

<p>Brimming eyes met his for an instant.</p>

<p>“And I love you,” she said with a queer soft fierceness. “I tell you, because
I will never see you again. I love you!”</p>

<p>Cunningham felt a nameless dread. Stephan looked at him with dreary, resolute
eyes. Maria’s lips were pinched and bloodless. The Strangers regarded him with
somber faces which were not unfriendly, but perturbingly sympathetic.</p>

<p>The gathering seemed to be something like a court. The women were gathered
around the outer edges. The men stood about a rock on which Stephan had seated
himself. Maria stood beside him. Cunningham found himself thrust gently
forward.</p>

<p>“My friend,” said Stephan wearily, “you find us gathered in council. Men say
that you kissed my daughter, Maria.”</p>

<p>Cunningham flushed, then stood straight.</p>

<p>“I did,” he said evenly. “I ask your permission to marry her. Is it a crime
for me to speak to her first and have her answer?”</p>

<p>Stephan shook his head wearily.</p>

<p>“No. No crime. And if you were one of us I would be glad. I think you are a
man. I would join your hands myself. But you are not of our people.”</p>

<p>“And who are you,” demanded Cunningham, “that I am not fit to marry into?”</p>

<p>Stephan’s voice was gentle and quaintly sympathetic.</p>

<p>“We have killed one man who knew the answer to that question,” he said in the
teasing soft unfamiliar accent that all the Strange People had. “We do not
wish to kill you. And you are not unfit to marry my daughter. My daughter, or
any of us, is not fit to marry you.”</p>

<p>Cunningham shook his head.</p>

<p>“Let me be the judge of that.”</p>

<p>Again Stephan made a gesture of negation.</p>

<p>“I think you are our friend,” he said heavily. “We need a friend of those who
are not like us. We may die because we have not such a friend. But you must
come here no more. What says the council?”</p>

<p>A murmur went up about the amphitheater&mdash;a murmur of agreement. Cunningham
whirled with clenched fists, expecting to see hostile faces. Instead, he saw
friendly sorry ones.</p>

<p>“He must not come again,” ran the murmur all about the crowd, in the faint and
fascinating dialect that could not ever be identified. Men gazed at Cunningham
with a perturbing sympathy while they banished him.</p>

<p>“But why?” demanded Cunningham fiercely. “I am your friend. I came hundreds of
miles because the picture of Maria drew me. I refused offers of bribes. That
man”&mdash;he pointed at Vladimir’s servant&mdash;“tried to kill me only today, only
because I am your friend. And what have I asked of you? If Maria tells me to
go, I will go. But otherwise&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Stephan put his hand on Cunningham’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“You must not come again,” he said quietly, “because Maria loves you also. Our
people know such things quickly. She has said that she loves you. And we dare
not let our women marry any man but one of ourselves. It is not that we hate
you. We kept that man from killing you today, and we would have killed him if
you said so. We will kill him for you now, if you tell us. But we dare not let
one of our women marry you. So you must go.”</p>

<p>“Will Maria tell me to go?” demanded Cunningham fiercely.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Maria, dry-lipped. “Go! Oh-h-h-h. Go, if you love me!”</p>

<p>She flung herself down upon the grass and sobbed. Some of the women murmured
to each other and one or two moved forward and patted her shoulders
comfortingly.</p>

<p>“She tells you to go,” said Stephan wearily, “because we would have to kill
you otherwise.”</p>

<p>“But why? Why?” demanded Cunningham desperately.</p>

<p>Stephan rose from his seat and spread out his hands.</p>

<p>“Because no woman can ever keep a secret from the man she loves,” he said
wearily. “Some day she would tell you who we are. And then you would hate her
and hate us. You would turn from her in horror, and you would denounce us. And
we would die, swiftly. I am not happy, my son. Maria is my daughter and I
would see her happy. But some day she would tell you who we are&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Cunningham found himself being crowded gently away from Maria. He thrust
himself fiercely against the pressure.</p>

<p>“But who are you?” he cried savagely. “Dammit, I don’t care who you are!
You’re making her cry! Let me pass! Let me get&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Stephan made a gesture. With the quickness of lightning Cunningham was seized
by a hundred hands. He fought like a fiend against the innumerable grips that
clasped his hands, his arms, his feet. But they were too many. He stopped his
struggling, panting, and stared raging at Stephan.</p>

<p>“We give you a gift,” said Stephan quietly. “Gold, my son. Much gold. Because
if Vladimir tells our secrets we will all be killed, and he threatens to
tell.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want your money,” panted Cunningham savagely. “I want this silly
mystery ended! I want Maria! I want&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Go in peace,” said Stephan drearily.</p>

<p>Cunningham was laid upon the ground and tied fast. He struggled with every
ounce of his strength, but in vain. The Strange People were too many and too
resolute. But they seemed to take pains not to injure him. Indeed, when they
put him in a litter and started off with him, there seemed to be a consistent
effort by the bearers not to make him even uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Cunningham raged and tore at his bonds. Then he subsided into a savage
silence. His lips were set into a grim firmness. Maria sobbing upon the grass
... this abominable sympathy for him....</p>

<p>The litter stopped. They took him out and cut his bonds. They offered him the
bags of hammered gold-pieces again.</p>

<p>“I don’t want them,” he said with grim politeness. “I warn you, I’m coming
back.”</p>

<p>The leader of his escort was the young man who had first come out of the woods
the first time Cunningham had seen the Strangers. He nodded gravely.</p>

<p>“I know,” he said quietly. “I loved a girl not of our people, last year.”</p>

<p>The litter-bearers had vanished into the woods. Cunningham matched at a straw
of hope. Perhaps here was a friend, or even a source of help.</p>

<p>“You understand,” he said in a hurried, eager undertone. “Perhaps we can&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I gave her up,” said the young Stranger quietly. “My people would have killed
her if I had married her. You see, I might have told her.”</p>

<p>He shrugged and pointed off through the woods.</p>

<p>“Coulters is there,” he said gravely. “You would not take gold. I am sorry.
But we think you are a man.”</p>

<p>“I’m coming back,” said Cunningham grimly.</p>

<p>The Stranger nodded and touched the hilt of his knife regretfully. He swung
away and vanished in the underbrush.</p>

<p>Cunningham started toward Coulters. He knew they would be watching him. But
perhaps a quarter of a mile on the way he stopped. He heard nothing and saw
nothing. He slipped aside into the woods. And he had gone no more than a dozen
paces before there was a little golden glitter in a ray of the dying sun. A
knife had flashed past his face not two feet away. He turned back, raging.</p>

<p>Later he tried again. And again a warning knife swept across the path before
him.</p>

<h2><a id='ch11'></a>11</h2>

<p class='ni'>Cunningham had nearly reached the valley in which the hotel was built when he
saw Gray below him, climbing sturdily up into the eyrie of the Strange People.
Gray had a rifle slung over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Gray!” shouted Cunningham.</p>

<p>Gray stared and abruptly sat down and mopped his forehead. He waited for
Cunningham to reach him.</p>

<p>“Damn you, Cunningham,” he said expressionlessly, “I like you, you know, for
all I think we may be working against each other. And word’s just gone in to
Bendale that you’ve been killed by the Strangers. I was going up in hopes of
getting to you before they wiped you out. And I already had cold chills down
my back, thinking of the knife that nearly went into it yesterday.”</p>

<p>“I’m safe enough,” said Cunningham bitterly, “but I’m run out of the hills.”</p>

<p>“Best thing, maybe,” said Gray. “I’m hoping, but I think there’ll be fighting
there tonight. A posse’s going to raid the Strangers after dark.”</p>

<p>“<i>I’m</i> going to raid the hills tonight,” said Cunningham fiercely, “and bring
Maria away with me. I’ll marry her in spite of all the Strangers in creation.”</p>

<p>Gray grunted as he heaved to his feet. “You’re a fool, Cunningham, and I’m
another. If you go, I go too. I might learn something, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Cunningham poured out the story of what had happened to him during the day, as
they made their way down to the hotel. The sole objection to him lay in the
fact that if Maria loved him, some day she would tell him who the Strangers
were. And she did love him. Vladimir was the only outsider who knew their
secret and he was threatening to disclose it, on what penalty Cunningham did
not know.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Gray quietly, “it would be a good thing if Vladimir did tell
what he knows. But I suspect he won’t, and for your sake I’d like to see you
safely married to that girl you’re so keen about before he did start to talk.
I’m with you tonight, Cunningham.”</p>

<p>“Better stay behind,” said Cunningham curtly. “They’ll be watching for me.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Gray quietly. “I sent some wires today and they may not be strong
enough. Two of us might get her out where one wouldn’t. And I’m thinking that
if you do marry her and she does tell you the secret of the Strangers, it
might avert a tragedy. I’ve done all I can without certain knowledge. Now,
watch your tongue when we reach the hotel.”</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>Cunningham ignored the raging astonishment with which Vladimir saw him,
and was savagely amused at the worriment the man showed. Vladimir had sent his
servant after Cunningham to kill him, and had been so certain of the
attainment of that object that he had already broadcast a tale of Cunningham’s
death which laid it at the Strangers’ door.</p>

<p>Cunningham waited for darkness. He was sure he had been watched back to the
hotel. But after darkness was complete and before the moon rose he and Gray
slipped secretly out of the house. They struck off down the valley, and when
the monstrous ball of the full moon floated over the hills to the east, they
made their way beneath thick trees, lest the moonlight show them to hidden
watchers. They had gone perhaps a mile when Gray pointed suddenly upward.</p>

<p>Far, far up, where a tree-grown peak ended in a bald and rocky knob, fires
were burning. Plainly visible in the clear night air, it could be seen that
there were many fires and many people about them. Through the stillness, too,
there came half-determinate sounds which might have been singing, or chanting,
or some long-continued musical wailing.</p>

<p>The moon was shining down upon the valley, with its tidy New England
farmhouses&mdash;upon Coulters, where uncomfortable rural police officers tried to
convince themselves that they would be quite safe in dealing with the Strange
People&mdash;upon Bendale, with its electric lights and once-a-week motion picture
theater. And the same moonlight struck upon a ring of fires high up in the
mountains where the Strangers moved and crouched. Old women gave voice to the
shrill lament that was floating thinly through the air.</p>

<p>Gray glanced once at Cunningham’s face and if he had been about to speak, he
refrained. Cunningham was making grimly for the hills.</p>

<p>The woods were dark. The two men crept through long tunnels of blackness,
where little speckles of moonlight filtered through unexpectedly and painted
the tree-trunks in leopard-spots. The valley had been calm, but as they
climbed, the wind began to roar over their heads, rushing among the
tree-branches with a growling sound. That noise masked the sound of their
movements. Once they saw one of the Strangers cross a patch of clear moonlight
before them. He was moving softly, listening as he half trotted, half walked.</p>

<p>“Sentry,” whispered Gray.</p>

<p>Cunningham said nothing. They went on, and heard voices murmuring before them
in a foreign tongue. They halted and swung to the right. Perhaps two hundred
yards on they tried again to continue up toward the heights. A crashing in the
underbrush made them freeze. A Stranger trotted within five paces of them,
peering about him cautiously. Only their immobility saved them from detection.</p>

<p>When he had gone they made for the spot from which he had come. It was
breathless work because at any instant a liquid little glitter in the
moonlight&mdash;a throwing-knife&mdash;might be the only herald of a silent and
desperate attack.</p>

<p>But they made their way on and upward. It seemed as if they had passed through
the ring of sentries. The trees grew thinner. The wind roared more loudly
above their heads. And suddenly they saw the glow of many fires before them.</p>

<p>If they had gone carefully before, now they moved with infinite pains to make
no noise. A single voice was chanting above the wind’s screaming. Gray
listened and shook his head.</p>

<p>“I thought I knew most languages by the sound of them,” he whispered, “or
could guess at the family anyhow. I worked on Ellis Island once. But I never
heard that one.”</p>

<p>They went down on their hands and knees for the last hundred yards. Then they
could see. And Cunningham stared with wide eyes, while Gray swore in whispers,
shaking with excitement.</p>

<p>There were a dozen huge bonfires placed in a monster circle twenty yards
across. They roared fiercely as the flames licked at the great logs they fed
upon. And the wind was sweeping up from the valley and roaring through them
and around them and among them.</p>

<p>The rushing of the wind and the roaring of the fires made a steady, throbbing
note that was queerly hypnotic. The flames cast a lurid light all around, upon
the trees, and the rocks, and the Strange People, and the vast empty spaces
where the earth fell away precipitously.</p>

<p>A single aged man chanted in the center of the twelve huge beacons. He was
clad in a strange, barbaric fashion such as Cunningham had never seen before.
And the Strange People had clasped hands in a great circle that went all about
the blazes, and as the old man chanted they trotted steadily around and around
without a pause or sound.</p>

<p>The old man halted his chant and cried a single sentence in that unknown
tongue. From the men in the circle came a booming shout, as they sped with
gathering speed about the flames. Again he cried out, and again the booming,
resonant shout came from the men.</p>

<p>“The sunwise turn,” panted Gray. “<i>Widdershins!</i> It’s magic, Cunningham,
magic! In New Hampshire, in these days!”</p>

<p>But Cunningham was thinking of no such things as magic, white or black. He was
searching among the running figures for Maria. But he did not see her. The
barbaric garb of the Strangers confused his eyes. That costume was rich and
splendid and strange and utterly beyond belief in any group of people only
eight miles from a New England mill-town with an accommodation train once a
day.</p>

<p>“Magic!” cried Gray again in a whisper. “Cunningham, nobody’ll believe it!
They won’t, they daren’t believe it! It’s impossible!”</p>

<p>But Cunningham was lifting himself up to search fiercely for a sight of the
girl he had found at the end of the route to romance and to high adventure.
Here were strange sights that matched any of the imaginative novels on which
aforetime he had fed his hunger for romance. Here was a scene such as he had
imagined in the midst of posting ledgers and day-books in a stuffy office on
Canal Street. And Cunningham did not notice it at all, because he was no
longer concerned with adventure. He had found that. He was fiercely resolved
now to find the girl who loved him and whose love had been forbidden by the
laws of the strange folk of the hills.</p>

<p>He saw her. Not in the circle. She was crouched down on the grass amid a group
of women. Rebellion was in every line of her figure. Cunningham loosened his
revolver. It was madness, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A shout rang out sharply. And the running line of men broke and milled.
Cunningham saw a hundred hands flash to as many knife-hilts. He saw the
sheriff and four frightened-looking constables come plunging out of the
brushwood, shouting something inane about halting in the name of the law.
There was a shout and a scream, and then a man’s voice raised itself in a wild
yell of command and entreaty. Cunningham’s own name was blended in a sentence
in that unintelligible language.</p>

<p>The Strangers darted for the encircling woods. The women vanished, Maria among
them. There was only a blank space in the open lighted by monster flames, and
the sheriff and two constables struggling with a single figure of the
Strangers.</p>

<p>“Go git ’em!” roared the sheriff, holding fast to the captive. “Git ’em!
They’re scared. Ketch as many as ye kin!”</p>

<p>Cunningham felt Gray holding him down in an iron grasp.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool!” rasped Gray in a whisper. “It’s too late! The Strangers got
away, all but one.”</p>

<p>The other men were racing about here and there. They found nothing but a bit
of cloth here, and a woman’s embroidered cap there, left behind in the sudden
flight.</p>

<p>The struggle in the open space ceased abruptly. The sheriff triumphantly
called to the others.</p>

<p>“I got one now! Dun’t be scared! We got a hostage!” He reared up and yelled to
the surrounding forest: “Dun’t ye try any o’ your knife-throwin’ tricks! This
feller we got, if we dun’t get down safe, he dun’t neither! Dun’t ye try any
rescuin’!”</p>

<p>He bent down to jerk his prisoner upright. And Cunningham heard him gasp. He
chattered in sudden stillness and the others huddled about him.</p>

<p>“Dead!” gasped one of them.</p>

<p>“He stabbed hisself, I tell ye,” shrilled the sheriff. “He stuck his own knife
in hisself!”</p>

<p>The five ungainly figures stared at each other, there amidst the roaring,
deserted bonfires. One of them began to whimper suddenly.</p>

<p>“They&mdash;they’ll be throwin’ their knives all the way down to the valley!” he
gasped. “They’ll be hidin’ behind trees an’ a-stabbin’ at us.”</p>

<p>The sheriff’s teeth began to chatter. The others clutched their weapons and
gazed affrightedly at the woods encircling them.</p>

<p>“We&mdash;we got to try it,” gulped the sheriff, shivering. “We got to! Else
they’ll get guns an’ kill us here. If&mdash;if ye see anything movin’, shoot it!
Dun’t wait! If ye see anything, shoot....”</p>

<p>With staring, panic-stricken eyes, they made for the woods. Cunningham heard
them crashing through the undergrowth in the darkness, whimpering and gasping
in terror at every fancied sound.</p>

<p>They left behind them nothing but twelve great fires that began slowly to burn
low, and a crumpled figure in barbaric finery lying with his face upturned
toward the sky. It was the young Stranger who only that afternoon had told
Cunningham of the girl he had loved and lost because she was not of the
Strange People. He had stabbed himself when captured, rather than be taken out
of the hills and forced to tell the secret of the Strangers.</p>

<h2><a id='ch12'></a>12</h2>

<p class='ni'>By morning the outside valleys were up in arms. One man&mdash;the foreigner of the
train&mdash;had been killed by the Strange People, and a servant of Vladimir’s had
disappeared among them. And witchcraft had been believed in not too long ago
in those parts. The wild ceremony of the Strangers among their blazing fires
was told and retold, and with one known killing to their discredit and the
long-smoldering hatred they had inspired, at the end it was related as
devil-worship undiluted. Something out of Scripture came to be put in it and
men told each other&mdash;and firmly believed&mdash;that children were being kidnaped
and sacrificed to the Moloch out of the Old Testament. The single Stranger who
had been killed became another human sacrifice, confusingly intermingled with
the other and more horrible tale, and there was no doubt in the mind of any of
the local farmers that the Strangers planned unspeakable things to all not of
their own kind.</p>

<p>Had any Stranger been seen without the hills, he would have been mobbed by an
hysterical populace. Sober, God-fearing men huddled their families together
and stood guard over them. Women watched their children with their husbands’
shotguns in their hands. Wilder and ever wilder rumors sped with lightning
speed from homestead to homestead in the valleys.</p>

<p>And all this was done without malice. The native-born people had distrusted
the Strange People because they were strange. They disliked them because they
were aloof. And they came to hate them because they were mysterious. It is
always dangerous to be a mystery. The story of what the sheriff and his four
constables had seen among the fires on the heights became enlarged to a tale
of unspeakable things. It would have required no more than a leader with a
loud voice to mobilize a mob of farmers who would have invaded the hills with
pitchforks and shotguns to wipe out the Strange People entirely.</p>

<p>They did not fear the Strangers as witches, but as human beings. They feared
them as possible kidnapers of children to be killed in the inhuman orgies the
fire-ceremony had become in the telling. They had no evidence of such crimes
committed by the Strangers. But there is no evidence of kidnaping against the
gipsies, yet many people suspect them of the same crime. Had any man spoken
the truth about the Strangers, he would have been suspected of horrible
designs&mdash;of being in sympathy with them. And because of the totally false
tales that sprang up like magic about their name, to be suspected of sympathy
with the Strangers was to court death.</p>

<p>Cunningham’s rage grew. Gray shrugged and rode furiously to Bendale to send
more telegrams. Vladimir went about softly, purring to himself, and passed out
bribes lavishly to those who could be bribed, and told lies to those who
preferred to be suborned in that way.</p>

<p>He was holding back the plans of mobbing. The sheriff, acting on his orders,
broke up every group of wild-talking men as soon as it formed. But Vladimir
held the Strange People in the hollow of his palm. Half a dozen murmured
words, and the men who had taken his lavished money would stand aside and let
the simmering terror of the countryside burst out into the frenzy of a mob.
And then the hills would be invaded by Christian men who would ferret out the
Strangers and kill them one by one in the firm belief that they were
exterminating the agents of Satan and the killers of innumerable children.</p>

<p>It did not matter that Vladimir’s hold was based on lies. The lies were much
more exciting than the truth. The truth was dull and bare. The Strangers had
been dancing about the fires. The constables had rushed out and they had fled,
without attempting to resist or harm their attackers. One of them had stabbed
himself when caught. And the truth was mysterious enough, and inexplicable
enough, but it did not compare with the highly colored tales of human
sacrifice and heathen orgies that had been embroidered upon the original tale.</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>Cunningham was inevitably in the thick of all these rumors. Men came
rushing with news. A Stranger had been seen lurking about where children were
playing. He was instantly suspected of planning to kidnap one of them. He had
been shot at and now was being chased by dogs. A Stranger had stopped a doctor
in the road and asked for bandaging for an injured arm. He had been shot by
one of the constables the night before. Other Strangers guarded him lest the
doctor try to arrest him while he dressed the wound.</p>

<p>That was in the morning. As the day went on the reports became more horrible.
It became clear that if any Stranger showed his face he would be shot at as if
he were a mad dog.</p>

<p>Word came from one place. Two Strangers had been seen and fired on. They
vanished, leaving a trail of blood. From another place came another report. An
old Strange woman had come out of the hills, to beg for medicines for their
wounded. Dogs were set on her as she screamed her errand. She fled, and knives
came hurtling from the brushwood, killing or wounding the dogs that were in
pursuit.</p>

<p>Gray had promised much. With a drawn and anxious face he had told Cunningham
that this day help must come. His telegrams must have produced results. They
must have had some effect! He had long since dropped his pretense that his
only mission in the hills was the study of the Strange People’s dialect. He
was off in Bendale, struggling with a telephone, pleading with a long-distance
operator to give him a connection to somewhere&mdash;anywhere outside.</p>

<p>Noon came and passed. The afternoon waned, with the inhabitants of the valley
growing more and more hysterical in their hatred of the Strange People, and
more and more detailed and convinced about the horrors they ascribed to them.
The wholly imaginary menace of the Strangers was making it more and more
difficult to prevent the formation of a mob. Men raved, wanting to protect
their children by wiping out the hill folk. Women grew hysterical, demanding
their annihilation.</p>

<p>Cunningham went to Vladimir. Vladimir blinked at him and licked his lips.</p>

<p>“Your servant is a prisoner among the Strange People,” said Cunningham,
coldly. “I’m authorized to say he’ll be killed if a mob enters the hills.”</p>

<p>Vladimir smiled, and all his cruelty showed when he smiled.</p>

<p>“How are you authorized to speak for them?”</p>

<p>“Let that go,” said Cunningham grimly. “He’s alive and safe, but he won’t be
if that mob goes in.”</p>

<p>The sheriff came in hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Vladimir&mdash;&mdash;” he began.</p>

<p>Cunningham cut into his report with some sharpness.</p>

<p>“Sheriff, the Strange People are holding Vladimir’s servant prisoner, as a
hostage. They’ll kill him if you raid the hills again.”</p>

<p>Vladimir laughed.</p>

<p>“He is vastly mistaken, sheriff. I had a servant here, it is true. But I sent
him to Boston, on a mission. And I had word from him yesterday that he was
quite safe and attending to my orders.”</p>

<p>He blinked at Cunningham and moved close to him.</p>

<p>“Fool,” he murmured gently, so that the sheriff could not hear, “do you think
his life counts any more than yours?”</p>

<p>The sheriff glared at Cunningham hatefully.</p>

<p>“Tryin’ to scare me, eh?” he rumbled. “I got enough on you to arrest you.
You’re in thick with them Strangers, you are. I reckon jail’s the best place
for you. You won’t get no chance to talk about bribes there.”</p>

<p>Cunningham felt himself growing white with fury. His threat to Vladimir had
been a bluff, and Vladimir had shown complete indifference to the fate of the
man he had sent to murder Cunningham. But there was one thing he would not be
indifferent to.</p>

<p>“You try to arrest me,” he said softly to the sheriff, “and I’ll blow your
head off. And as for you, Vladimir”&mdash;he made his tone as convincing as he
could&mdash;“I just tell you that you’d better call that mob off or I’ll tell them
who the Strangers are and where they came from!”</p>

<p>Vladimir’s eyes flamed close to madness, while his cheeks went ashen.</p>

<p>“So they told you!” he purred. “Sheriff, go to the door. I wish to speak to
this man privately.”</p>

<p>The sheriff, rumbling, moved away.</p>

<p>“My friend,” murmured Vladimir softly, “now I shall have to kill you. Not
myself, of course, because that would be illegal. And dangerous. But I give
you news. Today, while you and Gray were outside, a little note was tossed
into your window. I heard the breaking glass and found it. It was from a girl,
who signed, ‘Maria.’ She said that she loved you and would wait for you at a
certain spot to flee with you.”</p>

<p>Cunningham’s heart stopped. Vladimir laughed at his expression.</p>

<p>“Oh, she was met,” murmured Vladimir. “She was met&mdash;and arrested. She is held
fast. And tonight a story will go about and the women of the neighborhood will
learn where she is. She is in the hotel here, safely bound. With such a tale
as will be spread about, do you not think the women will pull down the whole
hotel to tear her in bits? Now do you go and tell the secret of the Strangers!
No one will believe you. But you believe me!”</p>

<p>He tossed a scrap of paper to Cunningham. And Cunningham knew that the story
was true.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Vladimir, purring, “I shall give orders that you be arrested. If
you are taken, she will be torn to bits. And that is how I kill you, my
friend. That is how I kill you! For I do not want anyone to live who will
remember or believe the secret of the Strangers.”</p>

<h2><a id='ch13'></a>13</h2>

<p class='ni'>Then the news took a definitely dangerous turn. A farmer who was hastening to
Coulters was stopped by a band of Strangers. They had taken his shotgun and
shells from him, contemptuously tossing him half a dozen of the square lumps
of gold. The gold would pay for the gun ten times over, but men raged. Another
man came in foaming at the mouth, with a similar tale. He had seen a Stranger
and raised his gun to fire as at a wild beast. A knife had flicked at him and
gone through the fleshy part of his arm. They took his gun and shells,
leaving gold to pay for them.</p>

<p>No one saw anything odd in firing on the Strangers at sight. But everyone grew
hysterically excited at the thought of the Strangers taking guns with which to
shoot back. Then a man rode up on a lathered horse, shouting hoarsely that
twenty Strangers had raided a country store some six miles away. They had
appeared suddenly. When they left they took half a dozen shotguns&mdash;the whole
stock&mdash;three rifles, and all the ammunition in the store. They left gold to
pay for the lot.</p>

<p>Cunningham heard all this as one would hear outside sounds during a nightmare.
He was like a madman. He would have gone rushing through the place in search
of Maria but that it was still broad daylight and there were twenty or more
armed men in the place, all mad with excitement and fury. As it was,
Cunningham was in a cold, clear-headed rage. He went to his own room and
packed his pockets with cartridges.</p>

<p>Vladimir was right in one respect. The natives were in no mood to listen to
the truth. They would believe nothing that he told them. He was suspect, in
any event. They classed him with the Strangers, and they classed the Strangers
with the beasts. Fighting such men was not fighting law and order. The sheriff
was bribed. The rest were wild with rage and terror. They did not know they
were catspaws for Vladimir. Even the sheriff probably knew but little of
Vladimir’s plans.</p>

<p>He went into Gray’s room and searched for a possible second revolver. As he
pawed grimly among Gray’s possessions he heard the sheriff speaking, through a
partition. Gray’s room was next to that occupied by Vladimir, and Cunningham
abruptly realized how Gray had obtained much information.</p>

<p>“I’m doin’ my best to hold ’em,” the sheriff was saying anxiously, “but it’s
gettin’ to be a tough job. I’d better send for militia&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Fool!” snarled Vladimir. “What do I give you money for? There will be no
fighting! We will march into the hills. We will pen up these folk&mdash;surround
them. If your mob kills a few, what harm? Afterward you shall pick out your
murderers&mdash;as many as you choose! They will confess to anything you choose,
after I have spoken to them. And then the rest of the Strangers will move
away. They will go away forever, with me! I will take them!”</p>

<p>“But it looks bad&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“They will lick my boots,” rasped Viadimir. “They will crawl upon their knees
and beg me for mercy. And I will give you four men to hang. They will confess
to their crime. And I will take the rest away.”</p>

<p>Cunningham nodded grimly. At least this clarified the situation a little.
Vladimir was afraid of the Strangers’ secret becoming known. He only wanted to
get them away. If he could find Maria and she would tell him, and Gray brought
the help he had promised&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Cunningham was not thinking for himself, except as his liberty meant safety
for Maria, and secondarily for the Strange People. But he would have to go
into every room in the hotel filled with armed and suspicious men. It was
lucky he had two guns. There would surely be shooting. There would probably be
a bullet or two for him.</p>

<p>“Now send your deputies to arrest Cunningham,” snapped Vladimir on the other
side of the wall. “Tell them to shoot him if he resists. He was teaching the
Strangers to shoot and advising them to resist arrest. That is enough.”</p>

<p>“I’ll send a bunch,” whined the sheriff uneasily. “He’s a desp’rit character.
Talkin’ about accusin’ me of takin’ bribes....”</p>

<p>“You’ll be rich for life when this is over,” Vladimir purred. “Remember that!”</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>The door closed behind the sheriff. Cunningham grinned savagely. He was to
have no chance at all. They had been sent to arrest him, after Vladimir had
given him news that would ensure his resisting. He would resist, right enough!
And then a wild and utterly reckless scheme sprang full-bodied into
Cunningham’s head.</p>

<p>He swung the door to&mdash;and heard a squeaking on the other side of the partition
as if a closet door had been opened. And then Vladimir spoke purringly in that
unknown language of the Strangers!</p>

<p>There could be but one person to whom he would be speaking at such a time and
in that language. Cunningham’s heart leaped violently. He heard voices
downstairs&mdash;men coming up to arrest him in his own room.</p>

<p>He darted out in the hall and plunged into Vladimir’s room, a ready revolver
upraised. Vladimir whirled and stared into its muzzle with ashen cheeks. For
once there was no purred jibe upon his lips, because Cunningham’s face was the
face of a killer after he had seen Maria in the clothes-closet, bound hand and
foot and with a gag in her mouth. She had been staring at Vladimir in horror,
but her eyes flamed at sight of Cunningham.</p>

<p>For the fraction of a second they gazed at each other. Then her eyes signaled
frantic warning. Cunningham whirled and dashed his revolver blindly in
Vladimir’s face as his hand came up with an automatic. Vladimir stumbled and
crashed backward to the floor.</p>

<p>Footsteps crashed on the steps outside. Nearly all the men in the hotel, it
seemed, were coming up in a body to see to the arrest of Cunningham. But he
paid no attention. He was ripping away at the gag and tearing loose the bonds
that held Maria fast.</p>

<p>“Vladimir told me you’d been captured,” he panted, “and said you’d be mobbed
tonight. Now he’s sent a gang to arrest me, knowing I’d resist and get myself
killed. We’ve got to make a break for it. All right?”</p>

<p>Maria’s eyes were like stars. Cunningham kissed her suddenly.</p>

<p>“My God!” he laughed shakily. “One can think of love-making even at a time
like this! Listen!”</p>

<p>The crowd on the stairs had reached the top. They crowded down the hall before
Cunningham’s own door. There they hesitated, shuffling uneasily. At last a
voice called loudly, “Open in the name of the law!”</p>

<p>There was no answer from Cunningham’s empty room. They waited breathlessly. A
man pounded cautiously on the panel of the door.</p>

<p>“Open in th’ name of th’ law!”</p>

<p>Still silence.</p>

<p>“M-maybe he j-jumped outer th’ window,” suggested someone uneasily.</p>

<p>“R-rush him,” urged a man safely in the rear.</p>

<p>Cunningham and Maria, two rooms away, heard a hand laid on the other room’s
door. They heard it fling open with a crash and the scuttling of feet as the
mob of hastily deputized men jumped to one side to be out of the way of
possible bullets. Dead silence greeted them. And suddenly they crowded into
the deserted place.</p>

<p>“Now!” said Cunningham sharply.</p>

<p>He darted out, Maria running with him. She fled to the stairs and down them,
Cunningham two steps in the rear. A single straggler of the men who were to
have arrested him remained in the hall. He turned his head stupidly at sound
of their rush. His mouth dropped open, but before his shout they were half-way
to the ground floor.</p>

<p>Cunningham stopped at the foot of the stairs to fire three times up at the
ceiling of the second floor. A cloud of smoke filled the hall, and heads that
had craned over the balustrade withdrew, in a panic. A dozen paces more and
the fugitives were out in the roadway. Half a dozen horses were tethered there
and Cunningham tore loose the reins and leaped on one. Maria sprang up lightly
behind him and he kicked the animal madly with his heels. It sprang into a
panic-stricken gallop and was off down the road.</p>

<p>They were nearly out of sight before the first of their pursuers had run out
into the road behind them. Then half a dozen puffs of smoke showed that they
were fired on, but an instant later they were out of sight around a bend in
the road.</p>

<h2><a id='ch14'></a>14</h2>

<p class='ni'>Cunningham laughed a little as the horse’s hoofs clattered beneath and the
white road shot past. Maria was clinging to his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Safe so far,” he told her, “but now we have to take to the woods. The hand of
every man is against us, Maria. Do you trust me to get you away?”</p>

<p>“Anywhere,” she said softly. “You know I do.”</p>

<p>A motorcar came racing toward them over the rough road. It was not fit going
for an automobile and the car swayed and lurched from side to side with
dangerous abandon. Cunningham swerved his horse out of the road. The car
slowed and stopped with a screaming of brakes. Cunningham’s hand fell to his
weapon.</p>

<p>Gray tumbled out of the cloud of dust that enveloped the machine.</p>

<p>“Cunningham,” he panted. “Just found&mdash;Vladimir had bribed the telegraph
operator. None of my wires got through. Found an amateur radio fan and he sent
my message. Relay League. Help’s coming. By airplane. Bendale is a town of
lunatics. Wild yarns have gone into it and a mob is coming out to wipe out the
Strangers. They think they’ve been burning children. You’ve got to get up to
the Strangers. Tell ’em about planes. Tell them to get going and keep moving
or there ’ll be a massacre. Help’s coming as fast as it can get here. But for
God’s sake keep them away from the mob. They’ll be wiped out!”</p>

<p>“I’m going to get Maria away,” said Cunningham defiantly. “I’m going to get
her out of this state and marry her. The Strangers and anybody else can go to
the devil!”</p>

<p>Gray, choking upon the dust he had swallowed, gasped out a raging order.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool!” he cried. “Look at her clothes! She’s in the Strangers’
costume! You’ll be spotted if you’re seen, and three townships are raving
crazy! A dog couldn’t get away from here like that! You’ll be shot at by every
damned fool in three counties and arrested anywhere else you go! Get up in the
hills and keep the Strangers moving! The planes may not get here until dark,
and they can’t land in the hills in the darkness. I’m going to meet them at
Hatton Junction and guide them here. You get up in the hills and keep the
Strangers moving or there’ll be a massacre! That mob will even wipe out the
children! Everybody’s crazy! You’ve got to save them, Cunningham! You’ve got
to!”</p>

<p>And Cunningham knew that he was telling the truth. The Strange People might
not fight, if he begged them not to. To desert them would mean a tragedy in
the hills. The people about them were no more accountable than so many
lunatics. But to ride among the Strange People with Maria upon his saddle! ...
They would know that she loved him, and they would believe that she had told
him their secret. They would never let him leave the hills again alive.</p>

<p>It was death either way, and probably for them both. He looked at Maria and
found her eyes misty with tears.</p>

<p>“Let me go,” she said suddenly, with a sob in her throat. “You go away. I will
go up to my people and tell them what this man has said. Without me, you can
escape. My people will tell me to die, but you will not know who we are and
you will never hate me or despise me....”</p>

<p>Cunningham caught her hand and laughed shortly.</p>

<p>“No, my dear,” he said grimly. “We won’t be separated. It’s a choice between
being shot like mad dogs or facing your people. We’ll ride up into the hills.
We’ll tell your people that help is coming to hold off the mob. Their lives
will be safe and their secret too, for all of me. And if we die, it will be
decently. I’ve two guns for the pair of us.”</p>

<p>He found himself laughing as he waved his hand at Gray and drove his horse at
the steep slopes that led upward to the tree-clad heights in which the
Strangers lurked.</p>

<p>As the trees closed over their heads he smiled again and swung Maria before
him. He gave the horse its head and the animal dropped to a plodding walk. And
they talked softly. They had but a little while to be alone and they had never
talked the tender foolishness that lovers know. Now they were riding at a
snail’s pace upward to the stern vengeance of the Strangers upon a woman of
their number who had loved outside the clan.</p>

<p>They spoke in whispers, not to avoid detection but because there are some
things that are too tender to be spoken aloud. And their eyes spoke other
things for which nobody has ever found words. Maria’s arm was about
Cunningham’s neck and her lips were never far from his own and it seemed as if
all trouble and care were very far away, though they were riding up to death.</p>

<p>The trees rustled above them. Birds sang all about them. And they rode through
an age-old forest upon a weary horse, a scarecrow of a man with a bandaged
shoulder and a girl in barbaric finery, gazing at him with tear-misted eyes.
And as they rode they talked softly, and now and then they smiled, and in
every speech and glance and gesture there was an aching happiness and a
wistful regret.</p>

<p>All this was very foolish, but it was the proper and authentic conclusion for
a man who has followed the route to romance and adventure to its appointed
ending.</p>

<p>But there came a little rustling in the undergrowth beside them as they went
on climbing up to the heights. Then other rustlings. Far away there was a
whistle as if someone signaled. And very suddenly an arm reached out from the
thick brushwood and seized the horse’s bridle. One of the Strangers stepped
into view and gazed steadily up into the muzzle of Cunningham’s revolver.</p>

<p>From all about them men materialized as if by magic. No man laid a hand on any
weapon. They looked at the pair upon the horse gravely, without rancor but
with infinite resolution.</p>

<p>And Stephan, Maria’s father, came into view and regarded them with weary,
hopeless eyes.</p>

<p>“Why did you come back?” he asked in a queer and resolute despair. “You knew
what we would have to do. Why did you come back?”</p>

<p class='ni'>The sun sank thunderously behind the mountain-range and tinted the tips of
all the peaks with gold. Little fleecy clouds floated overhead in contented
indolence. The wind of the heights was still. The pine-clad hills seemed very
soft and restful as the shadows deepened on the eastern slopes, and contrasted
strangely with the still-bright golden fields of the valleys yet unshadowed by
the mountains.</p>

<p>Stephan held out a weary hand, pointing. A sullen column of smoke rose from a
point far distant. He pointed again, where a thin wisp of vapor grew steadily
thicker and denser.</p>

<p>“Our houses,” he said bitterly. “They are being burned. Vladimir has spoken,
and we die.”</p>

<p>Cunningham clenched his fists as the sullen gray clouds rose slowly upward in
the still air. Once he saw figures moving about the base of the smoke. Once he
thought he heard yelling.</p>

<p>“I don’t think he’s told your secret,” he said after an instant. “That’s the
mob. Gray promised that help would come. He said it was coming by airplane.
And Vladimir&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He told Stephan swiftly what Vladimir had said to the sheriff: that the
Strangers were to be surrounded by the mob, and that then he would speak to
them; that they would submit, and that some would go away in chains to be hung
for the murder of his brother, and that he would take the others away with him
forever; that they would follow when he spoke to them and obey him in all
things.</p>

<p>Stephan’s eyes flashed fire for a second.</p>

<p>“Is life so sweet or peace so dear,” he quoted bitterly, “as to be purchased
at the price of chains and slavery?” He stopped short. “No,” he said quietly.
“We will not obey him. No!”</p>

<p>Cunningham felt again that curious impotent bafflement. Stephan had just
quoted Patrick Henry’s speech to the House of Burgesses, the famous “Give me
liberty or give me death” speech. And Stephan had never seen a revolver until
Cunningham showed him one, nor a shotgun save at a distance and in the hands
of the farmers about him. None of the Strange People were better informed.
Keeping passionately to themselves, it was possible that they would never have
seen a pistol if they were ignorant of them before they came mysteriously to
these hills. Revolvers are not common in country places, nor are those
possessed displayed.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Stephan with a faint smile, “how I was able to spare you for a
time. It is likely that we will all soon be dead. And then it does not matter
if you know our secret or not.”</p>

<p>“Tell me now,” begged Cunningham. “It will make no difference to you, and it
may mean everything&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Stephan smiled slowly at Maria, who was clinging to Cunningham’s arm as if she
feared that at any instant he might be torn away.</p>

<p>“You say you do not know,” he said with a wretched attempt at lightness.
“Maria loves you. You would despise her if you knew. Let her be happy as long
as may be.” He paused and surveyed the hillside with keen eyes, then added:
“We trust you. We might have killed many of that mob already. They were
careless. But we have fled before them. We will keep from killing them as long
as we can, because you have asked it.”</p>

<p>“Gray will be here!” said Cunningham passionately. “He has promised! Help will
come!”</p>

<p>Stephan shrugged his shoulders and gave a low-voiced order in the unknown
tongue which the Strangers spoke among themselves.</p>

<p>“Help,” he said in a moment more, and smiled very wearily indeed. “The
soldiers will come, no doubt. And then we die indeed. We move now, my son.”</p>

<p>Half a dozen Strangers hovered near Cunningham. They were guards, to prevent
his escape at any cost. That they would kill him to keep him from getting away
there was no doubt. That they hated him was totally improbable. The faces of
all the Strangers wore a settled, fatalistic look. Every one was now clad in
the barbaric costume they had worn about the fires the night before, as if
they had abandoned all hope of pretending longer that they were of the same
sort as the inhabitants of the valleys.</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>Cunningham followed as the Strangers moved on. Little bands of them were
constantly appearing unexpectedly from the woods and joining the main body.
There were quite two hundred in all when they passed over a hill-crest and
settled themselves in the valley beyond.</p>

<p>The mob had appeared from Bendale. On horse-back, in motor-cars and in wagons
drawn by teams, what seemed to be the whole population had come raging out to
Coulters. The farmers of the valley had put their women-folk together and come
armed with weapons, from shotguns to pitchforks. And they had surged into the
hills in quest of the Strange People. All had forgotten that the only thing
genuinely proved against the Strangers was the death of Valdimir’s brother.
All were hysterically convinced that the Strangers made a practise of
kidnaping children and sacrificing adults in devilish orgies by their fires.</p>

<p>The belief was not unparalleled. To be peculiar is to invite suspicion. The
Strangers were peculiar. Suspicion is always based on fear. What fear is more
terrible than that of harm to one’s children? Every unknown man or race of men
has been accused of the one crime. Gipsies are not yet freed of the suspicion
of kidnaping. A lurking tramp or wanderer is instantly and invariably
suspected of intent to commit the same offense.</p>

<p>Was it odd, then, that the secretive folk of the hills had been classed as
doubtful? The mysterious ceremony of the fires, as described by the ignorant
and frightened constables, was capable of any interpretation. What had been
doubts and vague surmises became certainties when coupled with the ceremony
which was meaningless unless sinister.</p>

<p>Now the Strangers had withdrawn from the first of the mountain-slopes. They
abandoned their homes to the mob without a struggle. The houses went up in
flames. The Strangers had seen the columns of smoke rising to the sky.</p>

<p>Men and women wore a look of settled calm. A mob that vastly outnumbered them,
and was vastly better armed, was seeking them in raging madness. They waited
to die. Some of the younger men chafed at the delay in fighting. With their
throwing-knives they might have picked off many of their persecutors, but
Stephan had forbidden it.</p>

<p>They waited. Darkness fell. Through the stillness of early night came the
sound of a shot, then another and another. Wild yells broke loose below.</p>

<p>After a long time a runner came panting to the bivouac. He had bound the
embroidered sash that was part of his costume about his arm, but it was
stained&mdash;a dark purple in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Stephan ordered another move. Uncomplainingly the Strangers rose and plodded
farther into the hills. The children were weary. Fretful little cries rose
from the long line. Women hushed them gently. There was little talk. Just a
long line of barbarously clad people plodding with bowed heads onward, onward,
onward, while a shouting, raving mob raged through the woods in quest of them.</p>

<p>Cunningham went with them. He had no choice, but it is doubtful if he would
have done otherwise had he been able to.</p>

<p>Again the weary people settled for a little rest. Yells sounded faintly, far
to the right. A red glow began and grew larger and became a house burning with
a crackling noise in the wilderness. Cunningham saw an old man rise on one
elbow and peer at the flames. His face was apathetic. Then he lay down again.</p>

<p>“That was my house,” he said quietly to the man nearest him, and was silent.</p>

<p>Again came runners, panting. One man was sobbing in rage and humiliation,
begging leave to plunge into the mob and die fighting&mdash;alone, if need be.</p>

<p>Stephan refused him gently.</p>

<p>“I think we die,” he said grimly, “but he”&mdash;Stephan pointed at
Cunningham&mdash;“has promised that help will come. I do not believe it, but we can
miss no chance. We have women with us, and children. We must hold ourselves
for them. While the least chance remains, we must live.”</p>

<p>Once more came the order to move. And once more the weary march began. It had
no object and it had no hope. But beneath the full moon the Strangers plodded
on and on, until the baying of dogs set up behind them.</p>

<p>“They’ve sent down in the valley and got dogs!” raged Cunningham in a blend of
fury and sick horror.</p>

<p>Stephan stroked his chin and gazed at Cunningham.</p>

<p>“What now, my son?” he asked.</p>

<p>Cunningham shook his head in despair.</p>

<p>“This is the end,” said Stephan quietly. “I think&mdash;I think we may let you go
on alone, if you wish. You may escape.”</p>

<p>“Maria?” demanded Cunningham, very white. He would feel like a coward and a
scoundrel if he deserted these people, but if he could save Maria he would do
it.</p>

<p>“No,” said Stephan. “She is my daughter and I would save her life. But if our
secret is known it is best that she die quickly with the rest.”</p>

<p>Cunningham groaned and clenched his fists.</p>

<p>“I stay,” he said harshly. “And&mdash;I fight with you!”</p>

<p>Sunrise broke upon the Strangers huddled high up on a bare and windswept peak.
Its first cold rays aroused them. Gradually it warmed them. And it showed them
clearly to a ring of still-raging men who were made savage by the ruin they
had wrought during the night. From fifty places in the hills thin columns of
smoke still rose wanly to the sky, from as many heaps of ashes that had been
the Strangers’ homes.</p>

<p>And shots began to be fired from the besiegers of the Strange People. Then
Vladimir rode forward on a white horse and shouted to them in that unknown
language.</p>

<h2><a id='ch16'></a>16</h2>

<p class='ni'>Cunningham could not understand the speech of Vladimir, nor the replies that
Stephan made. Only, once Maria clung to his arm in an access of hope.</p>

<p>“He has not spoken!” she whispered. “He is threatening now to tell them who we
are&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Then Vladimir was shouting promises, to judge by his tone. A moment later his
voice was stern.</p>

<p>Maria sobbed suddenly. A growl went up from the Strangers, running all about
among the huddled figures.</p>

<p>Far away over the hills a low-toned buzzing set up. It strengthened and grew
louder. A black dot hung between earth and sky. It grew larger. A second black
dot appeared; a third. Wings could be seen upon the first of the airplanes.
More and more appeared until there were six in all, flying in formation and
winging their way steadily toward the hills.</p>

<p>They darted back and forth, searching. Cunningham shouted joyously.</p>

<p>“There they are!” he yelled. “Tell Vladimir to go to hell, Stephan! We’ve got
help with us now!”</p>

<p>Vladimir had heard the sound of the engines and stared upward. Then foam
appeared upon his lips and he shrieked with rage.</p>

<p>“There will be soldiers upon those things?” asked Stephan quietly. The
Strangers were gazing up at the swooping aircraft that quartered the hills
like monster hawks, in quest of the Strangers and their enemies.</p>

<p>“Surely,” Cunningham told him joyously. “They’ll carry five men apiece, with
the pilots.”</p>

<p>Stephan rose and stepped forward, where he shouted in a stentorian voice to
Vladimir. Maria gasped in terror and clung close to Cunningham.</p>

<p>“He is&mdash;he is going to do as Vladimir says!” she cried. “Do not let him do it!
Oh, do not&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Stephan turned and spoke in a low tone in the unknown tongue of the Strangers.
And where there had been rebellion among the defiant folk on the peak before
he spoke, afterward there were grim smiles. Men’s hands loosened the knives in
their belts.</p>

<p>Stephan shouted again in apparent panic, pointing up to the flying things that
circled suddenly above them. And Vladimir’s face contorted in a grin of direst
cruelty. He called over his shoulder and rode forward until he was just out of
throwing-knife range. Then he shouted once more.</p>

<p>At Stephan’s low-toned order a cloud of knives went licking through the air
and fell at his horse’s feet. And Vladimir grinned savagely and rode up, quite
up, among the Strange People.</p>

<p>They cowered as he drew close to them. They crawled upon the ground as he
stared savagely about him. They shook in seeming terror as he snarled a phrase
or two at them. Cunningham gripped his revolver, his eyes blazing amid all his
bewilderment. He had never seen such beastly cruelty upon the face of any
living man. Maria clung close to him, shaking in unearthly terror.</p>

<p>Vladimir rode his horse toward a cowering group. They rolled away, gasping in
apparent horror, as the horse was upon them. Not one lifted a finger to defend
himself. They seemed stricken with utter, craven terror. They crawled abjectly
upon the ground before him.</p>

<p>Vladimir came upon the bullet-headed servant he had sent to kill Cunningham.
The man fawned up at his master, bound hand and foot as he was. Vladimir gazed
at him sardonically and spoke in a purring tone. Then he deliberately shot the
man dead.</p>

<p>The Strange People cringed. Then Vladimir saw Cunningham. He rode over and
stared down with cold, beastly eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah, my friend,” he purred. “You know the secret of my folk, you say. Perhaps
you lie, but it does not matter. You saw the end of my servant, did you not?
That was for failing to kill you as I ordered. Do you remember that after that
you struck me?”</p>

<p>Cunningham’s fingers itched on trigger.</p>

<p>“I do,” he said curtly. “You’d better run away, Vladimir. My friend Gray has
some unbribed officers in those planes that are going to land in a minute or
so.”</p>

<p>Vladimir laughed.</p>

<p>“What difference?” he asked amusedly. “My people are cowed, now. They will
swear to anything I choose to tell them. All that I need to do is hand over
some of them to be hanged. One or two will go for killing my servant. They
will confess to whatever I say. And I will take the others away with me.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure?” asked Cunningham grimly. “Quite sure?”</p>

<p>“But certainly,” Vladimir laughed again. “They are afraid I will tell who they
are. But you&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;Time is short.” He glanced at Stephan and his voice rasped.
“Take away his weapons!”</p>

<p>Stephan approached Cunningham, cowering from the menace of Vladimir’s eyes. He
seemed to be in the ultimate of terror, but as he drew near to Cunningham, and
Vladimir could not see his face, he smiled grimly. There was no terror on his
face then. He made a reassuring gesture.</p>

<p>“Take it!” rasped Vladimir harshly. “Disarm him!”</p>

<p>Stephan’s lips moved but Cunningham could not quite understand what he wished
to convey. But he had two revolvers and he thrust one into Stephan’s hand and
drew and jerked the other behind him while Stephan’s body covered the
movement.</p>

<p>“Ah,” purred Vladimir as Stephan drew back and handed over the weapon. “You
see it is necessary to kill you, Cunningham. My folk will take the blame for
it. I shall probably let Stephan hang for your murder. They need a lesson, you
understand. But I will be merciful. A bullet through the heart&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He raised Cunningham’s own revolver, but he never fired it. As his arm lifted,
Cunningham’s own weapon came around. But Cunningham did not fire either. There
was a panted ejaculation and a dozen Strangers seemed to spring from the
earth. With the savagery and directness of so many panthers they leaped upon
Vladimir. He was hidden from view in a mass of savagely stabbing figures who
clung to him in a grim silence. Vladimir screamed just once, and his revolver
went off with a deafening explosion. One of the Strangers rolled to the
ground, coughing, while he grinned in spite of his agony.</p>

<p>And then Vladimir fell with a crash to the ground and lay still.</p>

<p>There was a shout from the Strangers. Men yelled and the younger ones darted
out to where their knives had been tossed before Vladimir. They came racing
back with armfuls of the shining blades. They distributed them swiftly,
grinning as they did so.</p>

<p>And in less than two minutes from the time Vladimir had ridden up to the peak
where the Strangers lay barricaded, he had died and the Strangers were again
lying in wait for the attack that they were sure would result in their
annihilation.</p>

<p>But the great airplanes came coasting down heavily. Their motors shut off one
by one and they zoomed to lose speed and pancaked with sudden awkwardness to
the earth. This was no ideal landing-place. Three of them alighted safely. One
was tilted sidewise by a sudden gust of wing and crumpled up a wing against a
tree. Two others crashed their landing-gear on boulders on the rocky hillside.</p>

<p>Then Gray leaped out of the first to land, shouting frantically to the
besiegers to fire no more. Men jumped from the others and spread themselves
about the peak. They were alert grim figures with rifles which they handled
with familiar ease. And Gray came running up to the embattled Strangers, his
hands high above his head, and shouting that he was a friend.</p>

<h2><a id='ch17'></a>17</h2>

<p class='ni'>“Planes had to land at the Junction last night,” said Gray curtly to
Cunningham. “Didn’t get here until sunset and couldn’t land in unfamiliar
territory after dark, particularly this kind of territory. I went on and met
them last night. We took off at sunrise. What happened? Any fighting?”</p>

<p>“Several of us shot,” said Cunningham grimly. “Nobody killed that I know of.
But every house in the hills has been looted and burnt.”</p>

<p>“Fools!” snapped Gray. “But they’d do that.&mdash;What’s that?”</p>

<p>He was staring at a sprawled heap on the ground.</p>

<p>“That was Vladimir,” said Cunningham calmly. “He’d just shot his servant for
failing to kill me, and was shooting me down in cold blood when the Strangers
jumped him. You don’t get a murder case out of this, Gray. They killed him to
save my life.”</p>

<p>“Glad of it,” said Gray restlessly. “Now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“By the badge you’ve stuck on your coat,” said Cunningham grimly, “you’re a
detective of some sort. And I suppose those chaps who came in the planes are
Federal men. What do you want with the Strangers, Gray?”</p>

<p>Gray stirred uneasily. Then he faced Cunningham squarely.</p>

<p>“I’m in the immigration service,” he said flatly. “These people are aliens,
smuggled in. You can guess the rest of it yourself.”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” said Cunningham savagely. “There’s more to it than that, and they
won’t tell me; not even Maria.”</p>

<p>Stephan spoke quietly. “Do you know who and what we are?”</p>

<p>“I do,” said Gray curtly. “You’re&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Stephan stopped him with an upraised palm. His face was the color of ashes.</p>

<p>“Then you know,” he said tonelessly, “why we prefer to die here. And since our
young friend will not leave us of his own will, my young men will carry him,
bound&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Try it,” said Cunningham briefly. “If there’s fighting, I fight. If Maria
dies, I die. That’s all.”</p>

<p>He brought his remaining weapon into view and held it grimly.</p>

<p>Gray stared from one to the other.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders almost up to his ears and waved his hands
helplessly. And then he said quickly, “Since I know, and the soldiers know,
there’s no harm in telling Cunningham.”</p>

<p>Maria, her lips bloodless, whispered, “Tell him. It is best.”</p>

<p>But it was to Gray that Stephan turned. His back was toward Cunningham as he
made a gesture for Gray’s benefit alone. Cunningham could not see, but it
seemed as if Stephan had thrust up the wide sleeve of his embroidered jacket.
And Gray licked his lips and said, “Oh, my God!”</p>

<p>“I tell you my own story,” said Stephan quietly. “The others are much the
same. Twenty years ago I was the son of a village headman in Daghestan, which
is in southern Russia. And there came upon me suddenly this&mdash;this thing which
has made me one of the Strangers.”</p>

<p>Gray, shuddering, nodded. Cunningham raised his head.</p>

<p>“What thing?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“My own people would have stoned me when they knew,” said Stephan grimly. “My
own father would have killed me. And I was a fool then. I desired still to
live. I had heard whispers of this America, in which the son of the Governor
of Daghestan had found a mine of gold so rich that he must work it secretly.
It lay in a hidden valley, unknown to other men, and it was worked
by&mdash;Strangers, who were safe in that one small valley so long as they served
the lord Vladimir, while anywhere else in the world all men would kill them.”</p>

<p>“Why?” demanded Cunningham fiercely.</p>

<p>Stephan did not answer directly.</p>

<p>“I went down from the mountains that I loved, away from all my kin, and I went
to the Governor of Daghestan and said that I wished to work in the mine of his
son. And he sent me to a place, closely guarded, where there were others who
were&mdash;as I was. And a long time later a boat came, and it took us many days
upon the sea, and landed us secretly by night, and we traveled secretly,
hiding, for many more days. And we came to the hidden valley ruled by the lord
Vladimir and found two hundred other Strangers turned to slaves and working in
the gold-mine he had discovered. They told us we would have done better to be
stoned in our own villages than to come. We were driven to work with whips. If
we rebelled we were shot down by the guards, who carried guns.”</p>

<p>Gray moved suddenly.</p>

<p>“This was twenty years ago?” he demanded. “And you were kept a prisoner in
that valley all that time, by guards with guns?”</p>

<p>“All of us,” said Stephan quietly. He thrust with his foot at the body of
Vladimir, lying in the dust before him. “That was our master. He had us taught
the English language so that if other people came upon the valley we would
seem to be of this nation. Three times&mdash;no, four times&mdash;wandering men came
into the valley. None of them ever left it. They were killed by the
guards....”</p>

<p>Gray stirred, his eyes moving fascinatedly from one to another of the Strange
People.</p>

<p>“But we had been free men, once,” said Stephan proudly. “We wept at first
because we were&mdash;Strangers. Then we grew ready to fight because we were men.
Many times, in those twenty years, we planned revolt. There were two or three
Strangers among us who were from this nation. One of them became my wife and
the mother of Maria. She had been a teacher in the schools, and she taught us
much. But Vladimir seemed to hear our secret thoughts. Every time he
forestalled our plans and punished us horribly for daring to think of revolt.
Men said that he stretched threads of metal to our houses and that our words
traveled to him along those threads, so that he knew always what we planned.”</p>

<p>“Telephones,” said Gray, fascinated, “but in the walls. Of course he could
listen in.”</p>

<p>“So at last we made our plans in the woods of the valley.” Stephan spread out
his hands. “We stole of the gold we dug. We gave it to five of our number, and
they fled away. They bought horses and food&mdash;many horses and much food. They
found a hiding-place for us. And while they were doing that, Vladimir was
torturing us to learn where they had gone and why. But though four men and a
woman died, they did not tell. And suddenly, in a night, we Strangers who were
slaves of Vladimir, we fled from the valley. We killed the guards with our
knives and vanished, hiding in the secret place the first five men had found.
It was secret and secure. And then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Stephan hesitated.</p>

<p>“My wife, who was of this nation, had been born in these hills here. She told
us of these hills as of Paradise. So we sent again a few of our number here.
With the gold we had brought away, we bought ground. Then, a little by a
little, all of us came. We kept far from other people. We did them no harm.
Now they want to kill us, because Vladimir doubtless told them before he died
that we were lepers, and because we are lepers, we must die.”</p>

<p>He turned grimly to Cunningham and bared his forearm. And the skin of that
forearm was silvery.</p>

<p>Cunningham’s tongue would not move. Gray shivered.</p>

<p>“I’ll&mdash;I’ll admit,” he said shakenly, “I didn’t bargain for this. Good God!”
He stared at the somber-faced Strangers with a queer terror. Then he shook
himself suddenly. “But look here&mdash;&mdash;!”</p>

<p>Cunningham found himself speaking hoarsely. “Not Maria!” he gasped. “Not
Maria!”</p>

<p>Stephan’s face, the color of ashes, had only compassion upon it as he watched
Cunningham.</p>

<p>“Wait a bit,” cried Gray. “Wait a bit! Stephan! That&mdash;that thing on your arm.
It comes first on the elbows and knees, where the clothing rubs! Redness
first, then this?”</p>

<p>“That is it,” said Stephan quietly. “We have seen our children appear so. We
have tried&mdash;ah, how we have tried!&mdash;to keep them from being Strangers too. But
it is in the blood. Maria has showed it not even yet. But in time to come&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nobody,” panted Gray excitedly, “ever got it over fifty years of age!”</p>

<p>“Those who have come to us,” said Stephan, “have always been young.”</p>

<p>Gray struck his hands together.</p>

<p>“But it shouldn’t be that way!” he cried. “It should take all ages. It should
show on the face and hands! Not one of you shows it on the face or hands.
There should be a dark band across the forehead. The fingertips should be
silver, and the fingers should be twisted and bent. . . . Have you ever seen a
doctor?”</p>

<p>Stephan smiled grimly. “That”&mdash;he pointed again to Vladimir’s body&mdash;“when that
was our master, he had a doctor to keep us alive. And there was never any
doubt.”</p>

<p>“I was at Ellis Island,” said Gray excitedly. “I know what I’m talking&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is finished,” said Stephan grimly. “We die. Go and send your soldiers or
your people to kill us.”</p>

<p>“Cunningham, make him listen&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Go on, Gray,” said Cunningham hoarsely. His face was ashen. “They’d only put
us in some&mdash;some horrible colony somewhere. I&mdash;I don’t want to live after
this. If they want to die, let them. I’m going to stay and&mdash;and get killed
with them, if I can.”</p>

<p>“Idiot!” snapped Gray. “I’ve been telling you for half an hour that the
symptoms are all wrong. And I was on Ellis Island and I know what they have
got! And I know how they got it. Why, you idiot, don’t you see that Vladimir
was getting his father to send him slaves to work that damned mine? That the
only way they could be kept as slaves would be to make them think they’d be
killed if anybody else knew what he knew about them? They didn’t get that
thing naturally. They were deliberately inoculated with <i>psoriasis</i>, a
sub-tropical skin affection that looks enough like leprosy to give anybody a
start, but doesn’t make a person unfit to work! These poor devils thought they
were lepers, and they had a skin affection that is about as serious as
dandruff! Creosote ointment or arsenic taken internally will cure it in ten
days, and without one of those two things it lasts for years. Cooped up as
they were, they reinfected each other. Believing themselves pariahs, they were
afraid to run away from Vladimir until they had to. And he was trying to bluff
them back to work in his mine. Don’t you see, you idiot? Don’t you see? It was
a trick to get workers for his mine, workers who wouldn’t dare be disloyal to
him. And when they had run away, why, he had to get them back or they might
find out themselves what he’d done and tell where his mine was and about all
the crimes he’s committed these twenty years back. Don’t you see, Cunningham,
don’t you see?”</p>

<p>He turned to Stephan, who was staring at him incredulously.</p>

<p>“If you don’t think I’m telling the truth,” he snapped, “I’ll go and kiss
every pretty girl in camp to prove it! You’ve been here twenty years. I can’t
touch you. I can’t deport you. And I’m mighty glad of it! As for killing
Vladimir and his brother, I’m going to do my best to get you medals for the
performance. I’m going to set my men on these fool farmers and chase ’em home.
We’ll sue them for the houses they’ve burnt. We’ll put that sheriff in jail.
We’ll&mdash;we’ll&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;Cunningham, you lucky son-of-a-gun, I’m going to be best man
and kiss the bride!”</p>

<p>But Cunningham was already preceding him in that occupation.</p>

<h2><a id='ch18'></a>18</h2>

<p class='ni'>It was a very, very long time later. Cunningham was sitting peacefully upon
the veranda of a house among tall mountains. His eyes roved the length of a
valley that was closed in at the farther end by precipitous cliffs. There were
small, contented sounds from the house behind him.</p>

<p>A motor-car rolled up a smooth, graded roadway. A man by the road saw the
occupant of the car and shouted a greeting. Cunningham sprang to his feet and
ran down to meet it.</p>

<p>Gray tumbled out of the car and gripped Cunningham’s hand.</p>

<p>“I brought my fishing-rods,” he announced exuberantly. “Where’s that stream
you were writing about?”</p>

<p>“Find it in the morning,” said Cunningham happily. “How d’you like our
valley?”</p>

<p>Gray came up the steps and stared out at the empty space below him. There were
tall buildings down in the valley floor&mdash;great concrete buildings, with a tall
shaft-house where motors whirred and an engine puffed.</p>

<p>“There ain’t any such place!” announced Gray firmly. “I’m dreaming it! I found
a concrete road leading here. I passed half a dozen motor-trucks on the way.
And one scoundrel waved at me from a steering-wheel and I’ll swear he’s the
chap that had a knife in the small of my back once, ready to stick it in.”</p>

<p>“Quite likely,” admitted Cunningham, grinning. “He is quite glad, now, that he
did not stick it in. I’ve spread the news that you were the one who proved
their title to the valley, through twenty years’ occupation.”</p>

<p>Gray squirmed, then grinned.</p>

<p>“Might be useful,” he admitted, “to be popular here, in case there are any
more fire-ceremonies going on.”</p>

<p>Cunningham’s face was serious for a moment.</p>

<p>“They were desperate, then,” he said. “They’d tried the Christian God and
things still looked black. So they called upon some ancient deities that their
forefathers had worshiped.... You mustn’t blame them, Gray.”</p>

<p>“I don’t.” Gray grinned. “But I do want to study their dialect, Cunningham.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead. It’s disappearing. We’re going in for politics, and boy scouts, and
radios. We are a long way from a railroad, but our mine has built a road to
it, and we have a motor-truck line that’s as good as a trolley any day. We’re
highly civilized now, Gray.”</p>

<p>He opened the door into the house. And there was Maria to smile and give Gray
her hand.</p>

<p>“Your husband,” said Gray, “has been boasting outrageously about what’s
happened in the valley since you people came back.”</p>

<p>“He did it all,” said Maria proudly. “Nobody does anything, ever, without
asking him.”</p>

<p>Gray chuckled and lifted an eyebrow at Cunningham.</p>

<p>“You haven’t seen the prize exhibit yet,” said Cunningham hastily. “Chief!”</p>

<p>There was a movement and Stephan came up a flight of steps that led outside.
There was a tiny figure balanced on his shoulders. Stephan twinkled as he saw
Gray, and he set his burden on the ground.</p>

<p>“I found him,” he announced proudly, “going down the hillside with his
air-rifle. He was going to hunt bears. That is a grandson!”</p>

<p>Gray stooped and beckoned. The small figure came shyly forward.</p>

<p>“Son,” said Gray gravely, “don’t you waste your time on small game like bears.
Wait until you grow up a bit, and see a picture of a pretty girl in a
magazine, and you find out where she is. And then&mdash;why, then you can start out
on the route to romance and adventure.”</p>
